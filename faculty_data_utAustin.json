Álvarez is aProvost's Early Career Fellow. Before joining the University of Texas at Austin, she was anAmerican Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) 2021 Emerging Voices Fellowat Arizona State University, School of International Letters and Cultures. Dr. Álvarez earned a Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies with a certification in Women’s, Gender, and Sexualities Studies from the University of Houston. Her current research explores the development of border militarization along the U.S.-México border from the 1830s to the present.As Early Career Fellows in Borderlands History, Dr. Jonathan Cortez and Dr. Maira E. Álvarez founded theBorderlands Studies Working Group (BSWG)in the fall of 2022 to bring together graduate students, postdocs, and faculty from across the College of Liberal Arts to build a community around the shared intellectual interests of borderlands studies with the support of theActions that promote Community Transformation (ACT) Grant.At UT, Dr. Álvarez continues to work on digital initiatives focusing on public history to facilitate access to archival material, blending technology with scholarly research. For the past years, she has collaborated on multiple digital humanities projects. In 2017, she co-founded the digital humanities projectBorderlands Archives Cartography(BAC), a project dedicated to locating, mapping, and facilitating access to nineteenth and mid-twentieth-century borderland periodicals. By incorporating the actual addresses of the materials, BAC aims to establish a comprehensive historical record of newspaper establishments and printing-press locations in the border region. The primary objective of BAC is to visualize newspapers from both sides of the border, providing valuable insights into the U.S.-México borderlands and its communities before and after its division. This project adopts a digital humanities approach to expand the understanding of borders and improve accessibility to these materials, encouraging diverse forms of research and community involvement. Ultimately, BAC strives to cultivate interdisciplinary alliances and foster communities that transcend geographical boundaries.Additionally, during the summer of 2018, Dr. Álvarez was part of an intensive 6-day collaboration inTorn Apart / Separados, a critical data and visualization intervention centered around the United States 2018 \"Zero Tolerance Policy.\" This project contributes significantly to research on immigration and systemic racism within the context of a humanitarian crisis. Volume 1 of the project focused on visually representing the carceral geographies of immigrant detention in the United States, shedding light on the spatial aspects of these facilities. On the other hand, Volume 2 delved deeply into the financial aspects of immigrant detention, revealing the economic underpinnings of the system. Based on open-source data, the visualizations exposed a fractured U.S. immigration system and highlighted the proliferation of detention centers across the country, an issue that persists. The project continues to be a powerful tool for raising awareness of the humanitarian crisis.Another noteworthy project she is involved in isUnited Fronteras, phase one, which functions as a transborder digital cultural record documenting various digital initiatives focused on the U.S.-Mexico border. Commencing in 2019, this collaborative endeavor has brought together scholars from diverse disciplines and universities. The team comprises predominantly women and individuals from border regions in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. While a few members do not have direct ties to the border, they have cultivated a profound understanding of this distinct borderland through their experiences with immigration procedures or their research. In June 2021, the United Fronteras team achieved a significant milestone by organizing the inaugural bi-nationalUnited FronterasDigital Humanities Symposium, which served as a platform for activists, academics, students, artists, and organizations from both sides of the U.S.-México border to come together and exchange ideas.

Buenger was born and grew up in Ft. Stockton, Texas.  Both sides of his family told stories that stretched back to the Civil War, but his father’s German Texan relatives had a decidedly more jaundiced view of that conflict than his mother’s Anglo kin.  Those stories with their conflicting views of the past and his early years in the Trans-Pecos country gave him a lifelong interest in the nuanced history and varied cultures of the South and Southwest.  He left the Trans-Pecos for Houston and graduated from Rice University with a BA in 1973.   After earning a PhD from Rice he began teaching in the Department of History at Texas A&M University in 1979, and he remained at A&M until 2017 when he joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin.Research InterestsBuenger has written or co-written four books, co-edited three more, and authored numerous articles and book chapters.  His main areas of interest have been the connections between Texas and the South, Texas identity, historiography, the role of memory, the influence of borders, and the construction and evolution of culture in the Southwest.  He recently published a co-edited and extensively annotated version of the autobiography of William A. Trenckmann, a German language newspaperman and politician who was born in Texas in 1859 and died in Austin in 1935.  He is also writing a re-conceptualization of Texas and the Southwest with the tentative title, “Texas Since 1810:  Border Crossings and Shifting Identities over Time.” Walter L.

I am currently completing two books.Categories as Prisons(University Pennsylvania Press) explores how historiographical categories organize what questions about the past are permissible and therefore how archives and narratives are organized. The book explores how such categories as the Scientific Revolution, the Reformation, the Baroque, and the Enlightenment have rendered invisible entire chapters of the colonial history of the Americas. Coauthored with Adrian Masters,The Radical Spanish Empire(Harvard University Press), on the other hand, maintains that sixteenth-century Spanish America witnessed massive popular participation in the creation of new laws and radical forms of antislavery and abolitionism. The region also witnessed the creation of vast archives of new social and natural knowledge and the rise of systematic skepticism and philosophical pragmatism in governance. The book challenges the Anglo-American liberal notion that parliamentary democracy, humanitarianism, print culture, and the public sphere were the crucibles of modernityThe core of my intellectual project has been to demonstrate the deep formative role of \"Latin America” to the colonial history of the USA and to the history of \"Western\" modernity as a whole, not just slavery, globalization, and capitalism but also science, abolitionism, and democracy. This for me is a central issue of our times, particularly since I consider that Trump’s wall has been made with bricks baked in the ovens of historiography.I consider that historiographical categories such as the Enlightenment, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Atlantic Age of Revolutions not only illuminate but silence large areas of the human experience.  The category of the Enlightenment, for example, assumes that modernity emerged out the \"Republic of Letters\" and a \"public sphere\" that readers and writers conducted vicariously in cafes through newspapers and print culture. Working in tandem, this set of categories have blocked our understanding of forms of radical modernity in Spanish America in which knowledge was generated through petitions in manuscript and often in secret, not as the result of horizontal conversations but vertical ones. Entire libraries of new anthropological, physical, geographical, mineralogical, and botanical knowledge that changed the world emerged this way.  In numerous books and papers, I have explored how a host of historiographical categories have rendered invisible the intellectual communities of the global south.I am the author ofHow to Write the History of the New World(Stanford 2001--translated into Spanish and Portuguese);Puritan Conquistadors(Stanford 2006; translated into Spanish);Nature, Empire, and Nation(Stanford 2007). I have edited or coedited the following books:Entangled Empires : Anglo-Iberian Atlantic Worlds 1500-1830; The Atlantic in Global History, 1500-2000, 2nd edition   (with Erik Seeman);The Black Urban Atlantic in the Age of the Slave Trade(with Jim Sidbury and Matt Childs);Princeton Handbook of Atlantic History(with Joseph C.

Her dissertation won the University of Miami's Barrett Prize for the best Ph.D. dissertation on a Latin American topic in 2008. Her research focuses on the intersections between 19th-century republicanism, scientific thinking, the public sphere, and visual culture.Del Castillo's first book,Crafting Republic for the World: Scientific, Geographic, and Historiographic Inventions of Colombiaexamines how an array of nineteenth-century Spanish Americans marshaled in new histories, new sciences, and new geographies that offered radical new ways of understanding the past. Taking nineteenth-century Colombia as a case in point, this book explores the remarkable creativity and deep engagement with ‘on-the-ground’ realities that allowed these people to craft a republic that they believed the world would seek to emulate. Spanish American experiments with republicanism had no models to follow. From their perspective, neither the ossified aristocratic regimes of Europe nor the racist antebellum United States had been able to produce political and racial equality through republicanism. Spanish Americans had reason to believe that their republican experiments were on the vanguard of political modernity. Their creativity was inspired by the socio-political and spatial revolutions unleashed by Spanish American independence and early processes of republican state formation. This body of knowledge would allow them to propel economic development and circulation. Through detailed knowledge of local realities, Spanish Americans would best manage how territorial sovereignty would intersect with individual sovereignty in their present and future republics. These stories have long been buried under enduring narratives of 19th-century chaos, Liberal versus Conservative caudillos, aloof, disconnected elites that preferred Euro-centric models to local needs and realities, and, of course, Spanish American colonial legacies. The book argues that, if it were not for the deep cultural work carried out by 19th-century Spanish Americans like those considered here, the very category of ‘colonial legacies’ would not exist.Del Castillo's second book project,Colombia’s Paper Empire: Cosmopolitanism, Print Culture, and Geopolitics in the Age of Revolutionsexamines how a transnational and transatlantic cosmopolitan community came to invent, print, embrace, and finally disown a continental Colombian vision. The book explores the tension that existed between a hemispheric Colombian empire constructed transnationally via newspapers, atlases, and epistolary networks and the early Colombian Republic as a nation-state with designs onTierra Firme. Parsing out these Colombias reveals how a late 18th-century hemispheric ideal metamorphosed into an actual state on the ground, and, in turn, how the Colombian state on the ground unraveled precisely because of the hemispheric threat that it increasingly posed. These cosmopolitan Colombians engaged local cultures of print in London, Philadelphia, Paris, and Mexico City cocreating an array of “Colombias” materially and ideologically that, in turn, impacted the places of production. This book traces out how “Colombians” shaped British imperial and domestic policy, US notions of republicanism, French geopolitical strategies, and Mexican interpretations of the nation. In the late 1820s, the Colombian Republic’s military and diplomatic successes increasingly threatened the geopolitical interests of the same places that had helped bring the ideal of a continental independent Colombian hemisphere into being. By 1830, these external pressures and internal rivalries forced the Colombian Republic to dissolve. Several Spanish Americans nevertheless held on to and furthered a continental Colombian ideal well into the 1860s.Fellowships from an array of prestigious institutions have allowed Del Castillo to advance her research. They include the Institute of Latin American Studies at the University of London, the University of Notre Dame's Institute for International Studies, the Jeannette D.

My first bookHungry for Revolution: The Politics of Food and the Making of Modern Chile(University of California Press, 2021) explores the role of food politics and policy in the rise and fall of Chile's Popular Unity (UP) revolution. Currently, I am working on a transnational history of the Green Revolution and its antecedents that focuses on the production and consumption of commercial agricultural fertilizers. Among other things, this new research reveals the longstanding connections between the US South and Latin America that fueled the rise of the global fertilizer trade as well as our understandings of soil fertility and development.Prior to joining the faculty at UT, I was a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow in NYU's Core Curriculum program and an editor of theNACLAReport on the Americas, one of the most widely-read English-language quarterlies on Latin America and its relationship with the United States.

She pays close attention to contested understandings of gender and race in relation to labor and migration, poverty and malnutrition, health and medicine, print and broadcast media, political and popular culture. Her current project, \"The Discovery of Hunger in America: A Site of Public Crisis of Race, Health, and American Democracy,\" focuses on the explosion of public outcry following revelations about severe hunger and malnutrition among millions of poor Blacks, Native Americans, Latinas/os, and Appalachian whites starting in the mid-1960s and continuing over the next decade. She approaches this politics of hunger through an interdisciplinary approach that intertwines social, cultural and political history, medical humanities, media studies, critical race theory, and gender studies. Her first book,Battling the Plantation Mentality: Memphis and the Black Freedom Struggle(University of North Carolina Press, 2007),winner of the 2008 Philip A. Taft Award for the Best Book in Labor History, explores the meanings of freedom among urban migrants who protested racist labor practices, police violence (including rape), segregation, and movie censorship from World War II to the 1968 Memphis sanitation workers' strike. Freedom, she argues, represented an ongoing struggle against what many labeled a \"plantation mentality.\"Courses taughtUndergraduate courses: Rights in Modern America, the U.S. in the Civil Rights Era, Women and Social Movements, Women, Gender, and Sexuality in Postwar America (writing seminar), The Civil Rights Movement from a Comparative Perspectives (writing seminar), and Capstone in History. These classes frequently culminate with public-facing digital history projects such as ArcGIS StoryMaps, Pecha Kuchas, and blogs.

I earned a B.A. and M.A. in History at Universidad de los Andes (Bogotá, Colombia) and a Ph.D. in Latin American History at Yale University in 2018. Before coming to UT Austin, I taught at Universidad de los Andes and the University of Connecticut.My research and teaching focus on the interactions between Indigenous peoples and European empires in the early modern Atlantic world, combining material culture, agrarian history, and the history of books and maps. My bookCostumbres en disputa. Los muiscas y el imperio español en Ubaque, siglo XVI(Bogotá: Ediciones Uniandes, 2015) reframed the history of the encomienda—one of the most contentious institutions of the Spanish empire—through an ethnographic look at everyday interactions between Muiscas and Europeans. My current book manuscript,Empire's Fabric: The Making and Unmaking of the New Kingdom of Granada(Duke University Press, forthcoming), examines the making of a centralized political entity (a \"kingdom\") among the ethnically and geographically diverse landscapes of the northern Andes.I also have a keen interest in visual and public history and digital humanities. I have published widely on the history of Colombia's map, from the earliest Indigenous and European depictions of the New World to the early 20th Century. In 2015, I cofounded Neogranadina—a Colombian non-profit organization devoted to making digitization and digital tools available to local archives and community groups in Latin America. I also developed the bilingual digital history projectPaisajes coloniales: redibujando los territorios andinos en el siglo XVII|Colonial Landscapes: Redrawing Andean Territories in the 17th Century,which explores the transformation of Indigenous homelands into colonial landscapes through the analysis of a 17th-century painting of the Bogota savannah.

She first came to the University of Texas at Austin in 2002, where she received her BA in Plan II and History in 2006. Her undergraduate Honors Thesis explored Kierkegaard's notion of faith and its relationship to the Christian community. Ozanne entered the history graduate program at UT in 2007. HerMA report, \"The Healing Subconscious,\" investigated the historiography of psychology and religion by means of an early 20th-century pastoral counseling movement--the Emmanuel movement.She received her Ph.D. in U.S. history from UT in May 2013 forher dissertationentitled, \"Revelating Hicksites and Prophesying Seventh-day Adventists: Individual Religious Experiences and Community Ethics in Antebellum America.\" This work compared the visionary leadership of Elias Hicks, founder of Hicksite Quakerism, and Ellen G. White, founder of Seventh-day Adventism, to explore the relationship between religious experiences, religious communities' foundations, and the development of communal morality. She combined more traditional historical understandings of community formation in antebellum American with methods employed by scholars of religion to provide a clearer picture of the development of unique groups during this era of increased religious diversity. In particular, she argued that scholars must employ both Ann Taves’ and William James’ methods to study visions and revelations to comprehend how communities addressed the problem of religious experiences’ interiority through communal processes of evaluation.In recent years, Ozanne has edited and written the introduction to the late Professor Norman Brown's second book about Texas political history,Biscuits, The Dole, and Nodding Donkeys: Texas Politics, 1929-1932forUT Press, which was published in October 2019. She has also written about religious history and experience in digital and print media forThe Appendix,Religion Dispatches, andNot Even Past. Her essay \"Becoming Lost\" was published in an anthology calledEmpty the Pewswith Epiphany Press in December 2019. She is also researching a book manuscript that explores the concept of secular sainthood in US history.

Scholarship cannot substitute for real-lived experience, but I believe it can enhance our contemporary understanding of the choices we confront in the allocation of our resources, the structuring of our communities, and the judgment of merit.

This book charts the rise and fall of the American presidency, from the limited role envisaged by the Founding Fathers to its current status as the most powerful job in the world. The presidency is a victim of its own success -- the vastness of the job makes it almost impossible to fulfill the expectations placed upon it. As managers of the world's largest economy and military, contemporary presidents must react to a truly globalized world in a twenty-four-hour news cycle. There is little room left for bold vision. The Impossible Presidency traces America's disenchantment with our recent presidents to the inevitable mismatch between presidential promises and the structural limitations of the office.

I begin the story at the end of the last ice age, and drawing on a combination of archaeological records, radiocarbon-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions, oral history, and documentary archives I piece together a multi-millennial story of a place we now know as the “Chihuahuan Desert.” This work has been supported by visiting fellowships at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, New Mexico and the Tanner Humanities Center at the University of Utah.My first book,Border Land, Border Water: A History of Construction on the U.S.-Mexico Divide(University of Texas Press, 2019) is a history of the built world of the U.S.-Mexico borderline. Based on dozens of rare and never-before-seen historic maps, photographs, and blueprints, as well as archival documents and oral histories, I explain how and why the history of survey markers, surveillance infrastructure, and fencing is connected to the history of river engineering, damming, and other hydraulic projects. This book won awards from the Vernacular Architecture Forum as well as the Society of Architectural Historians for its contribution to our understanding of the built environment of the border.Before I received my doctorate in history from the University of Chicago, I studied art history at Harvard and Stanford.

At the same time, he aims to chart how capitalism works -- often invisibly -- to create and reinscribe racial, gendered, and sexual inequalities. His research focuses on energy and the environmental humanities; urban studies; and the culture and politics of service work and reproductive labor.Publications & Scholarly AwardsProfessor Beasley is currently finishing his first book manuscript,Expert Capital: Houston and the Making of a Service Empire,under contract with Harvard University Press.Expert Capitalexamines the intellectual and economic development of the globally integrated economy through the lens of the oilfield services industry. The book argues that oilfield services executives promoted a new ideology of American internationalism that envisioned the U.S. not as a center of manufacturing and production but as a white-collar headquarters serving the world through its provision of expertise. This corporate strategy and its accompanying ideology provided a way for U.S.-based firms to maintain cultural and economic power in an era of postcolonial nations’ rising political strength. In a moment when U.S. oil resources drastically diminished, exporting oil expertise offered a triumphalist explanation for the U.S. transition from an industrial to a post-industrial economy. The book follows the industry’s highest executives, its domestic and international blue- and white-collar employees, oil consumers at home and abroad, and international business and government officials to uncover the collaborations and negotiations that extended the industry’s reach across the globe and helped to cement the United States—and Houston in particular—as its international headquarters. While oil companies struggled over the ownership of the world’s oil reserves, oilfield services companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger forged a form of capitalism that escaped state oversight and slipped through national boundaries. Capitalizing on expertise remade both capitalism and U.S. foreign relations.Professor Beasley has published on the history of labor, business, gender and sexuality, cities, and international relations inDiplomatic History, Radical History Review, Urban History Review, The Oxford Research Encyclopedia of American History, The American Historian,andPublic Seminar.His dissertation was awarded the Honorable Mention for the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations’Betty M. Unterberger Dissertation Prize, and his article \"Service Learning: Oil, International Education, and Texas' Corporate Cold War\" won SHAFR'sStuart L. Bernath Scholarly Article Prizefor the best article on United States foreign relations in 2018.He was a recipient of theMiller Center National Fellowship from the University of Virginiaand theJohn E. Rovensky Fellowship in U.S. Business and Economic History, and his work has been supported with funding from the American Historical Association, theNew Orleans Center for the Global South at Tulane Universitythe Coca-Cola World Fund, and multiple research libraries. Alex Beasley grew up in central Georgia and attended The University of Georgia, where he earned a B.A. in history. After graduation, he lived in New York City before beginning his PhD program in American Studies at Yale University. While at Yale, he split his time between New Haven and Philadelphia, where he dissertated over tofu hoagies and not-quite-New-York bagels. After he finished his PhD, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at theMahindra Humanities Centerand a Member at theInstitute for Advanced Studyin Princeton, New Jersey. In fall 2018, Professor Beasley joined the American Studies Department at UT Austin.

She currently serves as the the Associate Director of the John L. Warfield Center for African and African American Studies. She received her Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization (2001) and her A.M. in History (2000) from Harvard University. She received her A.B. degree in History (1992) from Harvard College.Research InterestsShe is currently researching a book project entitled \"No More Auction Block for Me: African Americans and the Problem of Property\" which traces out some of the legacies of slavery for African American encounters with property and ownership. Specifically, it explores the interwoven concepts of race and property value from the vantage point of African American historical memory, political economy, and expressive culture. Situated at the intersection of legal and economic discourses, the notion of property also finds expression in literature and performance, material and expressive cultures. Thus, the project draws on the methodologies of cultural history, literary criticism, performance studies, ethnography, and critical theory. Her first book, Exiles at Home: The Struggle to Become American in Creole New Orleans is a cultural history of New Orleans' French-speaking free people of color over the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The dissertation on which it is based was awarded the Ralph Henry Gabriel Dissertation Prize by the American Studies Association in 2001.

Three of these books have been translated and published in Latin America. One appeared in Chinese translation. His first book on Argentina, published at Cambridge University Press, won the Bolton Prize. Brown also has edited a collection of essays on workers and populism in Latin America and co-edited books on the Mexican oil industry and on Argentine social history.In 2023, the University of Pittsburgh Press will publish Brown’s study on the diplomacy of General Omar Torrijos to convince Washington to renegotiate the 1903 Panama Canal Treaty. Having seized power in a coup d'état, the Panamanian strongman took nine years to reach a deal on a new treaty, which he signed with President Carter. In his time, General Torrijos gained international acclaim like few other Latin American leaders. He died in a plane crash in 1981.

        "intro": "Professor Emeritus; Distinguished Teaching Professor Ph.D., 1975, Cornell University Curriculum Vitae dfcrew@austin.utexas.edu GAR 2.126 campus mail code: B7000 History of popular culture and consumerism in twentieth-century Germany and Europe; history and politics of memory; visual history of Germany in the twentieth century, with specific focus upon photographic representations CURRENT RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION PROJECTS:At present, I am working on the following three book projects:Enigma in Black and White: Benno Wundshammer, Photo-Journalism and German History, 1939-1987This book project explores the life and career of Benno Wundshammer, a German war photographer, who produced images of World War Two that the Nazis used to promote their wartime propaganda. After 1945, he reinvented himself as a founding member of post-war West German photo-journalism. He is one example of an entire generation of so-called “Propaganda Company” photographers who significantly shaped the way World War Two was seen by Germans during the Nazi era and has been remembered since 1945. These photographers then played an important role in constructing the visual universe inhabited by West Germans during the early years of the Cold War. My current project takes advantage of an unusual resource, the extensive personal archive created by Wundshammer during his career, which is now part of the holdings of theBildagentur für Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte(formerlyBildarchiv preußischer Kulturbesitz-bpk) in Berlin.Disturbing Images: Photographing Hitler’s Third Reich, 1933-1945This book project explores the production and consumption of photographic images in the Third Reich. One of the Nazis’ main priorities after 1933 was to transform the ways that Germans saw the world and themselves. Although this project of reshaping popular perceptions and subjectivities employed written and spoken language, as well as music, it depended heavily upon images, particularly photographic images. The Nazi rise to power coincided with the breakthrough of photography and film as mass cultural and social practices in Germany. Between 1933 and 1945, millions of Germans took photographs and millions more consumed photographic images in illustrated magazines and went to the movies. What role did this unprecedented and pervasive visualization of popular culture play in constructing new views of the world that were consonant (or perhaps also in tension) with Nazi values?What Happens Next? Expectations, Hopes and Fears in German History, 1914-1989It is obvious that historians’ primary concern is with the past. But for Germans in the past what might happen in their futures was often as, sometimes even more important than what had already happened. This book will explore the varieties of ways in which Germans imagined what might happen next in the near and distant future. How did these imaginings affect the ways Germans behaved? On what sources of knowledge—past experiences, rumors, expert opinions—did Germans draw to decide what might happen next and how they should try to deal with these possible futures? This book will concentrate on the following periods of twentieth century German history: (1) the First World War, the German Revolution and the hyper-inflation of the early 1920s, (2) Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, (3) World War Two and the Holocaust, (4) the Cold War and the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. It will draw on personal diaries, letters and other so-called ego documents to reconstruct the great variety,inconsistencies and contradictions of  the ways in which individual Germans tried to grapple with the central question “What happens next?” CURRENT RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION PROJECTS:At present, I am working on the following three book projects:",
