My research focuses on people, commodities and landscapes in the interior regions between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. I have a particular interest in how legal categories of population, property and economy shaped and were shaped by the everyday experiences of social life. I am also committed to bringing both the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East into discussions of world history, especially narratives about capitalism and modern state formation. I teach courses on modern Middle East history, capital and crisis, Islamic law, and environmental history.

My current book project, Bedouin Bureaucrats: Nomads and Property in the Ottoman Empire, examines the ways tent-dwelling inhabitants of the Syrian interior contributed to and contested attempts to transform the desert fringe into a grain-exporting breadbasket in the second half of the nineteenth century. The project locates the experience of the Ottoman Syrian interior in a global context of commercial and administrative expansion into landscapes deemed underproductive, examining similarities and divergences with the American West and the Russian steppe. Using court and land registers, I uncover the stories of specific tent-dwelling individuals and communities involved in struggles over property, commerce, and the forms of modern governance. My other ongoing project combines my interests in the histories of Islamic law and capitalism. It explores the twentieth-century legacies of late Ottoman economy-making efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean, Iraq and the Persian Gulf, particularly the codification of civil law. My research has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Mellon Foundation, the Fulbright Foundation, and the Center for American and Overseas Research Centers.

Before coming to Stanford, I completed my PhD at the University of California, Berkeley and taught in the Persian Gulf for five years, first at Qatar University and then at New York University Abu Dhabi. At NYU Abu Dhabi, I co-founded OpenGulf, a set of interconnected digital projects focusing on historical documentation about the Gulf region.",,"Ottoman Empire and Middle East; Transnational, International, and Global History; No subfields found"

I am also available to mentor students pursuing a J.D./Ph.D.  For more information on this program, please visit the website of Stanford's Center for Law and History.In the meantime, please read carefully the materials about our program on our website, which should answer most questions.  In your application, be sure to list me as a potential mentor and explain why you think our areas of interest overlap.  You do not need to have identified a potential dissertation topic, although you can indicate potential ideas.  Your ""personal statement""  should not be a personal essay, but rather should describe the intellectual journey that led you to graduate school, referencing specific books, courses, professors, and research experiences.  If you were not an undergraduate history major, explain why history is your chosen discipline and the academic experiences that have prepared you for graduate study.  If you are applying for the joint J.D./PhD., be sure to explain why this program fits your particular interests.A polished writing sample using primary sources, high grades in history courses, and supportive letters from instructors who know you well are the most important parts of your application.  There is no minimum GRE score requirement.  Be aware that admissions decisions in our department are made collectively.  This means your application must appeal not only to me, but to my colleagues.  Therefore your application needs to show evidence of a certain level of professional development: that you understand primary source research and historiography and are interested in the general sweep of American history, not just your specific corner of research.  Interests often change and develop during graduate school, so the admissions committee is looking for a certain quality of mind, rather than a specific topic.  That said, definitely describe your research interests as you currently understand them, and how you see your approach opening up new ways of understanding the past.  Applicants to the J.D./Ph.D., program must apply and gain entrance separately to the history department and the law school.Finally, I request that all prospective applicants familiarize themselves with the realities of the academic job market in history.  Due to a contraction in the number of history faculty being hired, securing tenure-track employment has become extremely difficult, no matter your qualifications or accomplishments. The latest data is here.A Stanford specific study, including placement rates for history Ph.D graduates through 2013, can be found here.   Note that the Stanford data do not distinguish between tenure track and adjunct positions.   For a caution on graduate student debt, which can significantly impair your future happiness, click here.  While I will work assiduously to help all my advisees gain academic employment, I also encourage and support all students in considering a broad range of careers paths possible with a doctorate in history.",,United States; No subfields found

She is also the Susan Ford Dorsey Director of the Center for African Studies at Stanford and holds a position as a senior research associate in the Department of Historical Studies at the University of Johannesburg. 
Cabrita’s work focuses on religion, gender, and the politics of knowledge production in Africa and globally. Her latest book is Written Out: The Silencing of Regina Gelana Twala (Ohio University Press and Wits University Press, 2023). The book tells the story of Twala, an unjustly neglected literary and political figure in apartheid South Africa and colonial Swaziland. Cabrita shows that Twala’s posthumous obscurity has been no accident, charting how White scholars and politicians used racial and gendered prejudices to erase Twala’s work and claim her uncompensated intellectual labor for themselves. 
Cabrita has also investigated the transnational networks of the Southern African region including those which connect Southern Africans to the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans. Her book (The People’s Zion: Southern Africa, the United States and a Transatlantic Faith-Healing Movement, Harvard University Press, 2018) investigates the convergence of evangelical piety, transnational networks, and the rise of industrialized societies in both Southern Africa and North America. The People's Zion was awarded the American Society of Church History's Albert C Outler Prize for 2019. She is also the co-editor of a volume examining the global dimensions of Christian practice, advocating for a shift away from Western Christianity to the lateral connections connecting southern hemisphere religious practitioners (Relocating World Christianity, Brill, 2017).

Cabrita has a long-standing interest in how Southern Africans used and transformed a range of old and new media forms. Her first book (Text and Authority in the South African Nazaretha Church, Cambridge University Press, 2014) investigates the print culture of a large South African religious organization, while her edited collection (Religion, Media and Marginality in Africa, Ohio University Press, 2018) focuses on the intersection of media, Islam, Christianity and political expression in modern Africa.

Cabrita did her PhD at the University of Cambridge and was subsequently a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge. Before moving to Stanford, she held permanent posts at SOAS (University of London) and the University of Cambridge. Her research has been recognized by two major early-career research prizes, the British Arts and Humanities Early Career Research Fellowship (2015) and the Philip Leverhulme Prize (2017). In 2023, Cabrita was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Uppsala.

P. Daughton is Professor of History, and Professor (by courtesy) of French and Italian. He is a historian of Europe, imperialism and colonialism, and global history. His teaching and publications explore political, cultural, social, and environmental history, as well as the modern history of religion, technology, and humanitarianism. His affiliations at Stanford include the Europe Center, the Center for African Studies, and the Center for Human Rights and International Justice. His most recent book, In the Forest of No Joy: The Congo-Océan Railroad and the Tragedy of French Colonialism (W. W. Norton, 2021), tells the story of one of the deadliest construction projects in history. Between 1921 and 1934, French colonial interests recruited -- most often by force -- more than 100,000 men, women, and children to work on a 500-kilometer stretch of rail between Brazzaville and the Atlantic Coast. In the end, tens of thousands of Africans were dead, killed by mistreatment, starvation, and disease. The book painstakingly recounts the experiences of local communities in the face of colonial economic development, considers why the railroad witnessed such extraordinary violence and suffering, and explores how the rhetoric of ""civilization"" and ""development"" were used to justify the loss of so many African lives. In the Forest of No Joy was shortlisted for the Cundill History Prize and a finalist for the American Library in Paris Book Prize. A French translation is forthcoming with Éditions du Seuil.Daughton is also the author of An Empire Divided: Religion, Republicanism, and the Making of French Colonialism, 1880-1914 (Oxford University Press, 2006), a book that tells the story of how troubled relations between Catholic missionaries and a host of republican critics shaped colonial policies, Catholic perspectives, and domestic French politics in the decades before the First World War. Based on archival research from four continents, the book challenges the long-held view that French colonizing and “civilizing” goals were the product of a distinctly secular republican ideology built on Enlightenment ideals. A CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title, An Empire Divided was awarded the George Louis Beer Prize for the best book in international history from the American Historical Association, as well as the Alf Andrew Heggoy Book Prize from the French Colonial Historical Society. He is also the editor, with Owen White, of In God’s Empire: French Missionaries in the Modern World (Oxford University Press, 2012), a collection of essays on the role played by French religious workers in the empire and beyond. His essays and reviews, on themes related to colonial violence, international governance, informal empire, and cultural policy, have appeared in publications like the Journal of Modern History, the American Historical Review, and French Historical Studies. Daughton’s PhD advisees have written on a wide range of subjects, from nineteenth-century French cultural policies to the history of famine, and from alcohol consumption and violence in the First World War to the work of international NGOs in Algeria during decolonization.

I have also written on the circulation of goods, people, and ideas in the medieval Mediterranean.My first book (No Return: Jews, Christian Usurers, and the Spread of Mass Expulsion in Medieval Europe, Princeton University Press) uses the banishment of Jewish and Christian moneylenders to explore the rise of mass expulsion as a widespread practice in the later Middle Ages.

I also take enormous pleasure in examining a kind of scientific knowledge that did not have an autonomous existence from other kinds of creative endeavors, but emerged in the context of humanistic approaches to the world (in defiance of C.P. Snow's claim that the modern world is one of ""two cultures"" that share very little in common). More generally, I am profoundly attracted to individuals in the past who aspired to know everything. It still seems like a worthy goal.

My other principal interest lies in understanding the world of the Renaissance, with a particular focus on Italy. I continue to be fascinated by a society that made politics, economics and culture so important to its self-definition, and that obviously succeeded in all these endeavors for some time, as the legacy of such figures as Machiavelli and Leonardo suggests. Renaissance Italy, in short, is a historical laboratory for understanding the possibilities and the problems of an innovative society. As such, it provides an interesting point of comparison to Gilded Age America, where magnates such as J.P. Morgan often described themselves as the ""new Medici,"" and to other historical moments when politics, art and society combined fruitfully.

I have a certain interest in the relations between gender, culture and knowledge. Virginia Woolf rightfully observed at the beginning of the twentieth century that one could go to a library and find a great deal about women but very little that celebrated or supported their accomplishments. This is no longer true a century later, in large part thanks to the efforts of many scholars, male and female, who have made the work of historical women available to modern readers and who have begun to look at relations between the sexes in more sophisticated ways. Our own debates and disagreements on such issues make this subject all the more important to understand.

In addition to my work in the History Department, I currently direct Stanford's ESF (Education as Self Fashioning) Program for entering freshmen (https://sis.stanford.edu/education-self-fashioning-esf) and am also Faculty Director of Stanford's MLA (Masters in Liberal Arts) Program (https://mla.stanford.edu/), an evening masters program for adults who want an interdisciplinary learning community in which to cultivate their intellectual passions.  All this is to say that I enjoy working with students at all levels.  Prospective PhD students might enjoy reading my thoughts on getting a doctorate: https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-go-to-grad-school/

He specializes in the constitutional, political, legal, and intellectual history of the early United States. His primary focus to date has been the origins and development of the U.S. Constitution, in particular the ways in which Founding-era Americans understood and debated constitutionalism across the nation's early decades. His historical interests often intersect with modern legal debates over constitutional interpretation and theory, especially those centered on the theory of constitutional originalism. He is also especially interested in the method and practice of the history of ideas.His first book, The Second Creation: Fixing the American Constitution in the Founding Era (Harvard University Press, Belknap, 2018), rethinks the conventional story of American constitutional creation by exploring how and why founding-era Americans’ understanding of their Constitution transformed in the earliest years of the document’s existence. It investigates how early political debates over the Constitution’s meaning altered how Americans imagined the Constitution and its possibilities, showing how these changes created a distinct kind of constitutional culture, the consequences of which endure to this day. It won the 2017 Thomas J. Wilson Memorial Prize from Harvard University Press and the 2019 Best Book in American Political Thought Award from the American Political Science Association and was a finalist for the 2019 Frederick Jackson Turner Award from the Organization of American Historians. In addition, it was named a Choice Outstanding Academic Title for 2019 and a Spectator USA Book of the Year for 2018. It was reviewed in The Nation, was the subject of a symposium at Balkinization, and was chosen for the 2019 Publius Symposium co-hosted by the Stanford Constitutional Law Center and the Stanford Center for Law and History. He wrote about some of the book's central themes in an op-ed for the Boston Globe, and has discussed the book on ""New Books in History,"" ""The Age of Jackson Podcast,"" ""Law's Dimensions,"" and ""Riches & Power,"" as well as in interviews for Current and the Harvard University Press Blog.Connected to his work in constitutional history, Gienapp has written extensively on the relationship between history and constitutional originalism. His second book, Against Constitutional Originalism: A Historical Critique, to be published by Yale University Press in fall of 2024, presents a comprehensive historical critique of originalism. It argues that recovering Founding-era constitutionalism on its own terms fundamentally challenges originalists' unspoken assumptions about the U.S. Constitution and its original meaning. For a preview, see his article, ""Written Constitutionalism, Past and Present,"" published in Law and History Review, which was identified as one of the best works of recent scholarship in constitutional law in a review at Jotwell. He has written two essays on originalism and history that have been widely cited that appeared on Process: A Blog for American History, published by the Organization of American Historians. His work on originalism has been featured in The New York Times. Related to these endeavors, he is a member of the Historians Council on the Constitution at the Brennan Center for Justice and has contributed to a number of historians' amicus briefs to the Supreme Court of the United States.Gienapp has also written on a range of related topics pertaining to early American constitutionalism, politics, and intellectual history, modern constitutional interpretation, and the study of the history of ideas. He has published articles and book chapters in a host of venues, including the Journal of the Early Republic, Law and History Review, The New England Quarterly, and Constitutional Commentary. He co-organized, and contributed to, a symposium for the Fordham Law Review entitled ""The Federalist Constitution"" that explores the oft-overlooked constitutional ideas of the nationalist-minded politicians and jurists who initially held power and influence at the time of the Constitution's creation.Gienapp is currently writing a book on the forgotten history of the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution, currently entitled ""We the People of the United States: The Struggle over Popular Sovereignty and Nationhood."" It tells the story of the Preamble's early vitality and eventual descent into political and legal irrelevance as a way of exploring the broader struggle over popular sovereignty and national union in the early United States. It probes the often entwined debates over popular rule, sovereignty, federalism, and constitutionalism in the nation's earliest years to understand the full meanings of the Constitution's opening words: ""We the People of the United States."" Central to this project is the recovery of a distinct, yet forgotten, vision of constitutionalism that predominated at the American Founding and treated the Preamble as the central feature of the Constitution. It was most vigorously championed by the leading constitutional framers, James Wilson and Gouverneur Morris. Even though Wilson and Morris are largely unknown today, no two delegates to the Constitutional Convention played a more significant role in shaping the final Constitution, and in the years immediately following the Convention their particular conception of the Constitution was influential. Over the course of subsequent decades, however, their vision was quietly supplanted and largely pushed underground. Nonetheless, it reverberated for years to come, motivating abolitionists and other political activists eager to harness constitutional power to change an American order they deemed deeply unjust. Bringing this vision of the Constitution back into focus and understanding both its original vitality as well as how and why it disappeared offers an unfamiliar and revealing account of early U.S. constitutionalism, one that invites us to look upon the Preamble to the Constitution anew.Gienapp has lectured widely on the U.S. Constitution and the American Founding era. Among other appearances, he discussed the Constitution's history in an episode of the podcast, ""Writ Large,"" participated in a National Constitution Center Town Hall, ""The Founders' Library: Intellectual Sources of the Constitution,"" and a Constitution Day discussion of the Constitutional Convention, discussed James Wilson's contributions to U.S. constitutionalism in a webinar hosted by the James Wilson Institute on Natural Rights and the American Founding, was interviewed about the history of election disputes in the United States for The New York Times, and discussed the history of minority rule in the United States on NPR's All Things Considered. He also helped compile the National Constitution Center's Founders' Library.In addition to his appointments in the History department and at Stanford Law School, Gienapp is a member of the Stanford Civics Initiative.Gienapp is accepting graduate students to the Ph.D. program in History who are interested in working on all aspects of early American history and U.S. constitutional and legal history, including especially those students interested in Stanford's J.D./Ph.D. program in law and history.

Haber has spent his career investigating why the world distribution of income so uneven. His papers have been published in economics, history, political science, and law journals.
He is the author of five books and the editor of six more. Haber’s most recent books include Fragile by Design with Charles Calomiris (Princeton University Press), which examines how governments and industry incumbents often craft banking regulatory policies in ways that stifle competition and increase systemic risk. The Battle Over Patents (Oxford University Press), a volume edited with Naomi Lamoreaux, documents the development of US-style patent systems and the political fights that have shaped them.

His latest project focuses on a long-standing puzzle in the social sciences: why are prosperous democracies not randomly distributed across the planet, but rather, are geographically clustered? Haber and his coauthors answer this question by using geospatial tools to simulate the ecological conditions that shaped pre-industrial food production and trade. They then employ machine learning methods to elucidate the relationship between ecological conditions and the levels of economic development that emerged across the globe over the past three centuries.

He is broadly concerned with the causes and consequences of inequality, its relationship to various markets, and when, how, and why African Americans organized collectively to challenge systems of domination.  

His first book, The Bonds of Inequality: Debt and the Making of the American City (University of Chicago Press, 2021), won the Ellis W. Hawley Prize and James A. Rawley Prize from the Organization of American Historians (2022), the 2022 Kenneth Jackson Award for Best Book in North American Urban History, and was a finalist for the 2022 best new book in African American History and Culture from the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.

He is also co-editor of Histories of Racial Capitalism (Columbia University Press, 2021), which brings together scholars across a range of disciplines to revisit the persistent question of the relationship between race and capitalism. 

His writings have appeared in the Washington Post, The Nation, and the New York Times. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the American Historical Review.  

Destin Jenkins is working to two projects. The first is a concise history of debt in America (W.W. Norton). The second project weaves together three intersecting stories. The first concerns the rise of Black political representation in cities across America in the wake of the civil rights revolution. The second story is about the underground economy. The final story concerns privatization in and of local government. By grounding these accounts in granular, humdrum matters of revenues, expenditures, debt, and administration, the book expands the boundaries of African American history and carceral studies, and contributes to histories of capitalism and American political development.

Before joining the faculty at Stanford, he was the Neubauer Family Assistant Professor of History at the University of Chicago. He has held fellowships at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, and the Robert L. Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies at The New School.

History lured me way, especially after spending a junior semester at Leningrad State University in 1970 and having the chance to travel around the Soviet Union a bit. In graduate research and since coming to Stanford in 1982, I have focused on the early modern period (from the fourteenth century through the eighteenth). In almost all my work I have been explored the question of how politics worked in an autocracy. Theoretically I am interested in how early modern states, particularly empires, tried to create, at best, social cohesion and, at least, stability, by ritual, ideology, law and the measured use of violence. My early research focused on structures of power at the Kremlin court and the influence of kinship and marriage in politics and on social values from Muscovy to the Enlightenment (Kinship and Politics: The Making of the Muscovite Political System 1987); these themes encouraged my abiding interest in the roles of women in political ideology and practice. I have written two books on legal culture, one on disputes over honor (By Honor Bound 1999) and one on the practice of the criminal law (Crime and Punishment in Early Modern Russia 2012). Here I’ve contrasted the letter of the law with the workings of local courts, how people used the law, how judges and other officials played roles in the system, how the law was written and interpreted. In all this I’ve tried to place Russia in a comparative context where appropriate, trying to break down clichés of Russia being fundamentally different from European history or unknowable. 

My current work goes in several directions. One is a turn to the visual -- I have written several articles on the production and use in Russia of icons, frescos and miniatures as a medium for political communication. I am now finishing up a project on images of Russia produced by foreign engravers in early print publications and maps. The tension in these images between stock tropes of the engraver's trade and eye-witness information, is one fascinating aspect; another is the challenge to assess the impact of text and image on the reader. All in all, I have found that most illustrated works about Russia present a more nuanced understanding than the image of “despotism” that has caught a lot of scholarly attention. Finally, I am interested in how Russia functioned as an empire. I recently published a synthetic history (The Russian Empire 1450-1801 2017) of Russia as a “Eurasian politics of different empire,” and I plan to follow up this theme and return to the practice of the law by studying the implementation of Catherine II’s judicial reforms (1775) in the non-Russian provinces.",,"Eastern Europe, Russia and Eurasia; Transnational, International, and Global History; No subfields found"

It examines the transformation of elites and the emergence of new groups through scrutinizing differing claims to “honor” (and consequent re-definitions of what was “shameful”) entailed in claiming a public role without necessarily being a noble or an employee of the state. In addition to these specialist monographs, Lewis has written the first three volumes of a six-volume survey of the entire history of imperial China: The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han, China Between Empires: The Northern and Southern Dynasties, and China’s Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty.  These volumes serve as introductions to the major periods of Chinese history for non-specialists, and as background readings to introductory surveys.  In addition to recounting the major political events, they devote chapters to the most important aspects of the society of each period: geographic background, cities, rural society, kinship, religion, literature, and law.He created the Chinese Texts course, which is intended to teach students how to read Classical Chinese philosophy and history. The course uses texts from the Warring States and Early Han period, provides detailed analysis of the passages and how the translation was reached, and explains the uses of parallelism and rhythmic patterns in Classical Chinese.",,"Ancient; East Asia; Transnational, International, and Global History; No subfields found"

Braiding together the vivid stories of four migrants seeking to escape the turmoil of their homelands for the promise of America, the book gives this history a human face, telling the dramatic story of a Central American asylum seeker, a Cuban exile, a European war bride, and a Chinese refugee. As we travel alongside these indelible characters, In the Shadow of Liberty explores how sites of rightlessness have evolved, and what their existence has meant for our body politic. Though these “black sites” exist out of view for the average American, their reach extends into all of our lives: the explosive growth of the for-profit prison industry traces its origins to the immigrant detention system, as does the emergence of Guantanamo and the gradual unraveling of the right to bail and the presumption of innocence. Through these narratives, we see how the changing political climate surrounding immigration has played out in individual lives, and at what cost. But as these stories demonstrate, it doesn’t have to be like this, and a better way might be possible.Additionally, Minian has published articles in the Journal of American History, American Quarterly, and American Historical Review. In 2020, Minian was awarded with the prestigious Andrew Carnegie Fellowship.Minian's third book project, ""No Man’s Lands: A New History of Immigration Restriction,"" examines how during the late Cold War and its aftermath, U.S. officials created new spaces and territories designed to prevent Latin American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean migrants from entering the United States.

In my dissertation, I revisited the identity of the pro-Japanese collaborators, called the Ilchinhoe, and highlighted the tensions between their populist orientation and the state-centered approach of the Japanese colonizers. Examining the Ilchinhoe’s reformist orientation and their dissolution by the Japanese authority led me to question what it meant to be collaborators during the period and what their tragic history tells us about empire as a political entity. I am currently working on a book manuscript centered on the theme of collaboration and empire, notably in relation to the recent revisionist assessments of empire. My next research will extend to the colonial period of Korea after the annexation and will examine what constituted colonial modernity in people’s everyday lives and whether the particulars of modernity were different in colonial and non-colonial situations. To explore these questions, I plan to look at the history of movie theaters in East Asia between 1890 and 1945, a subject which will allow me to study the interactions between the colonial authority, capitalists and consumers, as well as to look at the circulation of movies as consumed texts.",,East Asia; No subfields found

I am a 2024 recipient of the Dan David Prize, the world’s largest prize for practitioners studying the human past.My first book, Necropolis: Disease, Power, and Capitalism in the Cotton Kingdom (Harvard University Press, Belknap imprint, 2022) concerns yellow fever, immunity, and inequality . During the nineteenth-century, epidemic yellow fever struck New Orleans every second or third summer, killing up to ten percent of the city’s population. This virus was shrouded in mystery. There was no cure, no inoculation, no conclusive evidence of disease transmission, and no satisfactory explanation for why it killed some while leaving others healthy. It was, moreover, a sudden and miserable way to die, with victims vomiting up partly coagulated blood, roughly the consistency and color of coffee grounds. The only way to protect oneself from the scourge was to bet “acclimated,” that is fall sick with the disease, survive, and gain lifetime immunity. About half of all people died in the acclimating process. In time, a disease hierarchy--what I term immunocapitalism--developed: the city became stratified between those whites who possessed immunity to yellow fever (the “acclimated”), those who remained vulnerable to the virus (the “unacclimated”), and those whose immunity status could only socially and economically benefit others (Black slaves and most free people of color). Disease was therefore no great leveler. Rather it heightened inequality in an already violent and unequal slave society. Necropolis received numerous awards. These include: the 2023 Frederick Jackson Turner Award for the Best First Book in American History from the Organization of American Historians; the 2023 Prize in American History from the American Historical Association (formerly the Dunning Prize), awarded biennially for the best first or second book in US history; the 2023 Simkins Prize from the Southern Historical Association; the 2023 Broussard Prize from the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic; the 2023 Kemper and Leila William Prize for the Best Book in Louisiana History from the Louisiana Historical Association and the Historic New Orleans Collection; the 2023 PROSE Award for Excellence in Humanities from the Association of American Publishers; and the 2023 Humanities Book of the Year Award, Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities.I am also interested in historical notions of consent (sexual or otherwise); syphilis and shame in the American Civil War and Gilded Age; slave revolts in the United States and the Caribbean; anti- and pro-slavery thought; class and ethnicity in antebellum America; the history of life insurance and environmental risk; comparative slave systems; technology and slavery; the Haitian Revolution; and boosterism in the American West.Born and raised in New York, Washington D.C., and London, I earned my BA in history (cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) from Yale University in 2011.

She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Professor Schiebinger received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1984 and is a leading international authority on gender in science and technology. Over the past thirty years, Schiebinger's work has been devoted to teasing apart three analytically distinct but interlocking pieces of the gender and science puzzle: the history of women's participation in science; gender in the structure of scientific institutions; and the gendering of human knowledge.Londa Schiebinger presented the keynote address and wrote the conceptual background paper for the United Nations' Expert Group Meeting on Gender, Science, and Technology, September 2010 in Paris. She presented the findings at the United Nations in New York, February 2011 with an update spring 2014. The UN Resolutions of March 2011 call for ""gender-based analysis ... in science and technology"" and for the integrations of a ""gender perspective in science and technology curricula."" Again in 2022, she prepared the background paper for the United Nations 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women’s priority theme, Innovation and Technological Change, and Education in the Digital Age for Achieving Gender Equality and The Empowerment of all Women and Girls. Since 2023, Gendered Innovations has been a member of the UNFPA Equity 2030 Alliance. In 2011-2014, Schiebinger entered into major collaborations with the European Commission and the U.S. National Science Foundation to promote Gendered Innovations in Science, Health & Medicine, Engineering, and Environment. This project draws experts from across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia, and was presented at the European Parliament, July 2013 as Gendered Innovations: How Gender Analysis Contributes to Research. In 2018-2020, Schiebinger directed the European Commission Expert Group to produce Gendered Innovations 2: How Inclusive Analysis Contributes to Research and Innovation.

But Should They be Gendered? (2019). Schiebinger served as a member of the Faculty Planning Committee for the Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute. Schiebinger's work in the eighteenth century investigates the circulation of knowledge in the Atlantic World. In particular she explores medical experimentation with enslaved populations in the Caribbean. Her Secret Cures of Slaves: People, Plants, and Medicine in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World reconceptualizes research in four areas: first and foremost knowledge of African contributions to early modern science; the historiography of race in science; the history of human experimentation; and the role of science in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world. Her prize-winning Plants and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World investigates women's indigenous knowledge of abortifacients and why this knowledge did not travel. Londa Schiebinger has been the recipient of numerous prizes and awards, including the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize and John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship.

My work is located at the intersection of the fields of histories of state formation and labour history. I am particularly interested in the histories of government workers and how this labour history intrinsic to the state apparatus recasts our understanding of state formation.
I am currently working on the manuscript of my first book, provisionally entitled Sovereign Labour: Constables and Watchmen in the Making of the Modern State in India, c. 1860-1950. This monograph is a study of police constables and village watchmen in Bengal from the promulgation of the Police Act in 1861 until the upheavals of decolonisation in the mid-twentieth century. It reframes the history of constables and village watchmen, usually represented as government functionaries, as the history of a distinctive form of labour. 
The most important methodological innovation of this study is to bring methods from the historiography of labour in South Asia in conversation with the vast archive of the colonial police and to demonstrate how we can rewrite police history as labour history. Sovereign Labour charts the contours of the market of security labour in eastern India and locates the emergence of colonial police workforces within the rhythms of this labour market. It reveals the patterns in the history of constabulary recruitment; examines the implications of the conditions of police work for the nature of police power; delineates the internal segmentation within the world of police labour, and the defining role of caste in shaping modern policing apparatuses in colonial India; and brings out fresh evidence about the myriad modes of politics devised by police workers in this region. More broadly, my aim is to clear a conceptual ground for the study of forms of labour within the apparatuses of the modern state as well as demonstrate how the history of the labouring lives of government workers can provide a fresh entry point into the nature of the modern state in South Asia.

She is also a public historian interested in understanding slavery and its legacy at institutions of higher learning and Confederate memory and memorialization.Her first book, Before Dred Scott: Slavery and Legal Culture in the American Confluence, 1787-1857, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2016. It draws upon a remarkable collection of nearly 300 freedom suits filed in the St. Louis circuit court to examine the legal history of slavery and freedom in the American Confluence, a site where portions of present day Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri meet. In this fluid region, it argues, ordinary people—including masters, slaves, indentured servants, and all those they came into contact with—developed a distinctive legal culture characterized by a sophisticated and widespread knowledge of formal law, the hallmark of which was the landmark United States Supreme Court case Scott v. Sandford. You can listen to Professor Twitty discuss this research on podcasts with New Books Network and the Institute for Justice’s Bound by Oath episode on “John Rock and the Birth of Birthright Citizenship.”She is currently pursuing two new book projects. The first examines the multiple forms of unfreedom that persisted across the putatively “free North” in the first half of the nineteenth century. The second explores the strange career of ratification in the making of state constitutions.Professor Twitty has also been active in efforts to study and contextualize the practice of slavery on college campuses generally and at the University of Mississippi, specifically. A founding member of the University of Mississippi Slavery Research Group, she has presented her own research on student slaveholding wealth and the memory of Reconstruction at the University of Mississippi, represented the UMSRG at national conferences, advised UMSRG graduate student researchers, and helped establish a campus slavery tour program. Professor Twitty has likewise worked to help the University of Mississippi confront its racially divisive past. In the Spring of 2016 she was at the forefront of the history department’s efforts to persuade the administration to revise the text on a plaque it had placed in front of the Confederate monument on the University’s campus and co-authored a departmental report detailing the historical context and meaning of the Confederacy and the Confederate monument at the University. She was subsequently appointed to serve on the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on History and Context, which produced a comprehensive set of recommendations about how the University should contextualize important historical sites on campus in the Summer of 2017 and resulted in the creation of six historical markers on campus.As part of her on-going research into the history of the University of Mississippi, Professor Twitty discovered the full text of the address that was given by Mississippian Charles Scott at the 1906 unveiling of the Confederate monument on the University of Mississippi’s campus. This speech was reprinted by the Vicksburg Herald on May 11, 1906, and has been transcribed in full. Professor Twitty subsequently wrote about the discovery and its significance for The Atlantic.Professor Twitty has also served as Secretary for the American Society for Legal History and currently serves on the editorial board of the Journal of American Constitutional History and on board of directors of the Freedom Suits Memorial Foundation.She joined the faculty at Stanford University in the fall of 2023 after teaching at the University of Mississippi and the Kinder Institute for Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri.

She specializes in American history before 1900, especially the history of ideas and the history of science.She is the author of five books. Most recently, How the New World Became Old: The Deep Time Revolution in America (Princeton, 2024) shows how the idea of deep time transformed how Americans see their country and themselves. Deep time refers to the idea that Earth is billions of years old and not 6,000 years old, as a literal reading of the Bible might suggest. Over a single century, from the American Revolution to the invention of the automobile, the majority of Americans came to see their ostensibly New World as the oldest world of all. It was a place of primordial natural beauty and wonder, from Yosemite to Niagara Falls. It was also a place of awe, a land once stalked by terrifying beasts, from T. Rex to saber-toothed cats. Over 100 illustrations bring the lost world of ancient America to life, showing how Americans crafted a modern nation built on their ancient land.She is currently editing a book with her Stanford colleague Jessica Riskin entitled The Apes & Us: A Century of Thinking about Humans among the Primates. It brings together leading anthropologists, primatologists, and historians to reflect upon the many ways we’ve explored the human/ape boundary since the Age of Darwin. The book emerges from an exhibit we staged at Stanford in 2024.Other recent books include Time in Maps: From the Age of Discovery to Our Digital Era (Chicago, 2020), edited with her Stanford colleague Karen Wigen. Assembling a group of distinguished historians, cartographers, and art historians, the book explores how maps around the world for the last 500 years have ingeniously handled time in the spatial medium of maps. American Enlightenments: Pursuing Happiness in the Age of Reason (Yale, 2016), reveals how early Americans grappled with the promises of the Enlightenment – how they used new questions about the plants, animals, rocks, politics, religions and peoples of the New World to imagine a new relationship between the present and the past, and to spur far-flung conversations about a better future for all of humanity. Earlier books and articles have explored America's long tradition of looking at the ancient classical world for political, artistic, and cultural inspiration.

In my scholarship and teaching, I employ interdisciplinary historical methods to explore questions of water control, agrarian reform, and the effects of climate and weather on the process of social revolution.I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in modern Latin American and Caribbean history, historiography and film, history of US-Latin American/Caribbean relations, environmental history of Latin America and the Caribbean and the United States, climate ethics, and water history (see current and past course offerings in sidebar to the right). I am accepting graduate students for fall 2024, but before contacting me, please become familiar with my work. Specific questions engaging with my work and how it relates to your own research interests are more fruitful as a basis for conversation than generally asking to learn more about my work.My first book, Watering the Revolution: An Environmental and Technological History of Agrarian Reform in Mexico (Duke, 2017; winner, 2018 Elinor K. Melville Prize for Latin American Environmental History; short-listed, 2018 María Elena Martínez Prize for Mexican History), investigates how people managed their water—via dams, canals, and groundwater pumps—in a great crucible of the Mexican Revolution of 1910-20, the arid north-central Laguna region. In so doing, it demonstrates how Mexican federal engineers were not merely passive implementers of large-scale state development schemes such as agrarian reform. Instead, to implement the latter, they actively mediated knowledge between state and society, identifying what they thought was technologically possible and predicting its environmental consequences.The book also explains how engineers encountered an intrinsic tension between farmers’ insatiable demand for water and the urgency to conserve it. By closely examining how the Mexican state watered one of the world’s most extensive agrarian reforms, the book tackles an urgent question in the literature on postrevolutionary Mexican state formation, Latin American environmental history and history of technology, and global development studies: how and why do governments persistently deploy invasive technologies for development even when they know those technologies are ecologically unsustainable?To answer this global question, my book integrates environmental and technological history along with social, economic, political, and legal analyses based on extensive research in archival sources, journals, newspapers, and government publications in Mexico and the United States. Using this “envirotechnical” analytical framework, the book uncovers the varied motivations behind the Mexican government’s decision to use invasive and damaging technologies despite knowing they were unsustainable. My book thereby transforms our understanding of human-nature interactions, water policy, and agricultural development in Latin America. As such, it has been reviewed by nearly 30 US and international journals of history, technology studies, agricultural and environmental sciences, and water management.My research on agrarian reform and water management in north central Mexico led me to investigate how weather and geography shaped the process of social revolution and development in Cuba. In my forthcoming book  Climates of Revolution: How Weather and Geography Shaped Cuban Development, 1955-1971, I combine environmental history and historical climatology to argue that extreme weather events such as drought and hurricanes were not merely infrequent external shocks to Cuba, quickly entering and exiting the main anthropocentric stage of its theater of revolution. Instead, these events, along with a diverse geography forged by an archipelago, were long enmeshed in Cuban politics, economics, society, and culture, and thereby shaped the origins and progression of the 1959 revolution in ways largely overlooked by historians.Specifically, the extremely variable climate of the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains simultaneously protected Fidel Castro’s guerrillas from Batista’s army and became a second ‘enemy’ due to the environmental hardship the barbudos (a machista moniker for the guerrillas meaning bearded ones) endured. After 1959, this barbudo experience informed the way the new revolutionary Cuban state weathered the severe effects of the 1961-2 drought and Hurricane Flora in October 1963. As much as the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1963, I argue that these weather events shaped Cuba's developmental path that culminated in the 10 million-ton sugar harvest campaign of 1970 and escalated into a war of words between Cuba and the United States that was intertwined with the larger geopolitical conflict over the Cuban Revolution.",,"Latin America; Science, Technology, Environment, and Medicine; Transnational, International, and Global History; No subfields found"
