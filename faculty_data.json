        "intro": "Office Hours: Wed, 1:30-3:30 pm, or by appointment;chalhoub@fas.harvard.edu\n\nSidney Chalhoub taught history at the University of Campinas, Brazil, for thirty years. He moved to Harvard in July 2015. A social historian of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Brazil, his first  monograph,Trabalho, lar e botequim(1986), is a study on working-class culture in Rio de Janeiro, based mostly on the analysis of homicide trial records.Visões da liberdade(1990) explores enslaved people’s petitions for freedom and other judicial cases to understand the role of the enslaved in bringing about the demise of slavery in Brazil.Cidade febril(1996) is a history of epidemics in nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro, focusing on public health policies regarding housing for the poor, on how race informed medical thinking, and on popular resistance to smallpox vaccination.Machado de Assis, historiador(2003) analyzes slavery, race, and the politics of literature in the work of the most important Brazilian novelist of all times.A força da escravidão(2012) investigates the practices of illegal enslavement and the precariousness of freedom in nineteenth-century Brazil.\n\nChalhoub co-edited, with former students and colleagues, six volumes on different topics and approaches to the social history of Brazil: on how to read literature as a social historian; on Black thinkers and their critique of slavery and racial ideologies; on the political cultures of enslaved and “free” workers; on the arts of healing, medical and popular. He has recently edited, accompanied by detailed critical studies, two long-forgotten nineteenth-century books:Fantina, cenas da escravidão, by Duarte Badaró (first published in 1881; critical edition in 2019), which is a novel about the alleged social and legal seigneurial prerogative to sexually abuse enslaved women;História e descrição da febre amarela, by Pereira Rego (1851; critical edition, 2020), is a history of the first yellow fever epidemic in Rio de Janeiro told from the perspective of an author who fought against the disease as a medical practitioner and as a member of the city’s board of health.\n\nChalhoub has supervised 31 completed doctoral dissertations, 23 master’s theses, and 30 senior theses. He has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Michigan, a Tinker Visiting Professor at the University of Chicago, and a research fellow at Stanford University and in the International Research Center “Work and Human Lifecycle in Global History” (Re:work) at Humboldt Universität, Berlin.  He has served departments and university administrations in several capacities, perhaps most notably as director (1998-2008) of theArquivo Edgard Leuenrothat the University of Campinas, the most important archive of its kind for gathering materials on twentieth-century Brazilian social movements. He was a founder of and remains associated with the Centro de Pesquisa em História Social da Cultura (CECULT), University of Campinas. Chalhoub was chair of the Latin American Studies Association (LASA) fact-finding delegation sent to Brazil toreporton the impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff (2016) and is currently president of the Brazilian Studies Association,BRASA.\n\nIn a recentinterviewto theJournal of Global Slavery, he spoke about his trajectory as a historian of slavery.

Alberto is a historian of Afro-Latin American lives, thought, and politics as they unfolded in the aftermath of slavery, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. Her work explores the intersections of ideas of race and nation in Latin America, with a focus on how Afro-Latin Americans have shaped and contested the region's ideologies of racial inclusiveness in their ongoing struggles for recognition and equality.\n\nAlberto’s latest single-authored work isBlack Legend: The Many Lives of Raúl Grigera and the Power of Racial Storytelling in Argentina(Cambridge University Press, 2022).Black Legendreconstructs both the life story of and the legends surrounding Raúl Grigera, a Black celebrity and icon of the Buenos Aires nightlife in the early 1900s. It examines the role of “racial storytelling” in constructing Whiteness and Blackness in post-independence Argentina and the power of racial stories to shape the fates of individuals, communities, and nations. Alberto’s first book,Terms of Inclusion: Black Intellectuals in Twentieth-Century Brazil(University of North Carolina Press, 2011), charts the changing terms through which self-defined Black intellectuals in three major Brazilian cities negotiated the meanings of racial inclusiveness in their multi-racial nation, and the place of people of African descent within it, between 1920 and 1980. Her co-edited volumeRethinking Race in Modern Argentina(with Eduardo Elena, Cambridge University Press, 2016) isan interdisciplinary collection of essays that newly places twentieth- and twenty-first century Argentina in conversation with the literature on race and nation in Latin America more broadly. Her most recent co-edited work, with George Reid Andrews and Jesse Hoffnung-Garskof, isVoices of the Race: Black Newspapers of Latin America (1870-1960) (Cambridge University Press, 2022), a volume of selected articles from the historical Black presses of Latin America, annotated and translated for English-language audiences.\n\nHer work has received support from the Social Science Research Council, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Council for Learned Societies, among other institutions, and has been recognized with the Roberto Reis Prize for Best Book in Brazilian Studies (2012), the Warren Dean Prize for Best Book in Brazilian History (2013), and the James Alexander Robertson Prize (2017).\n\nBefore joining the faculty at Harvard, Alberto taught in the departments of History and Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of Michigan.  Her teaching has included courses on Latin American history; comparative race, racial ideologies, and racial narratives in Brazil, Argentina, and Afro-Latin America; the borderlands of history and fiction; and the history and philosophy of History.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(ZoomLinks to an external site)\n\n\n\nGeorge Aumoithe, BA (Bowdoin), MA, MPhil, PhD (Columbia), RYT-200 (Yoga Alliance), is a scholar-artist and historian of the 20th century United States. Professor Aumoithe joins Harvard as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of History and the Department of African and African American Studies. His scholarly interests intersect at histories of U.S. politics, civil rights law, public health administration, and comparative welfare state studies.\n\nProfessor Aumoithe pursues research, writing, and teaching along with creative practice. His first book manuscript, tentatively entitledMedical Scarcity: The Resegregation of Healthcare in America, traces the genealogy of scarcity in public healthcare in the U.S. by following the decades-long story of healthcare retrenchment in public hospitals from the postwar period to the near present. From his Columbia University dissertation, the manuscript’s archival research spans seven presidential archives from the Johnson to Clinton administrations, features numerous hospital closure cases, and focuses on New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corporation—the nation’s largest public healthcare system. Under the musical act Efemèr, Professor Aumoithe released the extended play albumYearningin 2020. Self-produced through the independent record label Makeshifting Music, the debut EP explores themes of doubt, intimacy, and misconnection in a world plagued by socio-political tumult. Professor Aumoithe composed a film score for the short documentary filmBoukman’s Prayer(dir., Richard Brookshire) in 2021. He is recording a second EP for Efemèr tentatively entitledHealing. Future scholarly articles will examine the history of hospital desegregation jurisprudence, analyze the legal silos of healthcare, public health, and welfare law, and meditate on the ethics of institutionally mistreated and unrepatriated remains of 1985 MOVE bombing victims in Philadelphia. A poem about Black Studies pedagogy in the age of online education is forthcoming in the third volume ofBlack Pulsations(ed., Patrice Nganang).\n\nEmerging scholarship progresses on two tracks. One evolving book project entitled “The Only One: American Exceptionalism in a World of Universal Healthcare” revisits the classic question of why the U.S. lacks national health insurance through a history of racism. It also questions how industrialized and developing countries adopted privatization ideas from the U.S. Another incipient book project entitled “Borrowed Care: A History of Healthcare Worker Flows from the Global South to the Global North,” historicizes the racialized strata of healthcare labor in the 20th century U.S., focusing on nursing and care work paraprofessionals from the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.\n\nMany awards, grants, and fellowships have supported Professor Aumoithe’s work, including the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation (now, Institute for Citizens & Scholars), the Center for Engaged Scholarship, the American Philosophical Society, the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine, the Teagle Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, and the Leadership Alliance. He was a 2019 J. Willard Hurst Fellow through the American Society for Legal History and the University of Wisconsin School of Law and an ombuds for the 2019 and 2020 Law and Society Association meetings.\n\nProfessor Aumoithe was born to Haitian immigrants in Brooklyn, New York, raised in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and lived with host families in Tunis, Tunisia, and Toyohashi (豊橋市), Japan.Before joining the academy, he assisted the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network’s national policymaking. Prior to Harvard, Professor Aumoithe was tenure-track Assistant Professor of Global Health in the Department of Africana Studies at Stony Brook University, affiliated with the program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science. At Stony Brook, he taught classes on the history of AIDS and Black urban politics and established the Global Health and Health Inequality Mapping Lab, which augmented ArcGIS technologies with sonic applications to study the COVID-19 pandemic. At Princeton University’s Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies, he was a postdoctoral research associate for the theme of “Law and Legalities” and the sub theme of “Law and Difference.” Professor Aumoithe organized the 2019 Princeton workshop “Law, Difference, and Healthcare: Making Sense of Structural Racism in Medico-Legal History.” He is a 200-hour registered yoga teacher trained in vinyasa who incorporates mindfulness and accessible chair-based movement exercises in his teaching.\n\nPhoto credit:Elliott Jerome Brown Jr.\n\n\n\nSelect Publications:\n\nBroadcast Media:",

        "intro": "I am a historian of the late Ottoman Empire and the Modern Middle East. My research focuses on people, commodities and landscapes in the interior regions between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. I have a particular interest in how legal categories of population, property and economy shaped and were shaped by the everyday experiences of social life. I am also committed to bringing both the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East into discussions of world history, especially narratives about capitalism and modern state formation. I teach courses on modern Middle East history, capital and crisis, Islamic law, and environmental history.\n\nMy current book project, Bedouin Bureaucrats: Nomads and Property in the Ottoman Empire, examines the ways tent-dwelling inhabitants of the Syrian interior contributed to and contested attempts to transform the desert fringe into a grain-exporting breadbasket in the second half of the nineteenth century. The project locates the experience of the Ottoman Syrian interior in a global context of commercial and administrative expansion into landscapes deemed underproductive, examining similarities and divergences with the American West and the Russian steppe. Using court and land registers, I uncover the stories of specific tent-dwelling individuals and communities involved in struggles over property, commerce, and the forms of modern governance. My other ongoing project combines my interests in the histories of Islamic law and capitalism. It explores the twentieth-century legacies of late Ottoman economy-making efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean, Iraq and the Persian Gulf, particularly the codification of civil law. My research has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Mellon Foundation, the Fulbright Foundation, and the Center for American and Overseas Research Centers.\n\nBefore coming to Stanford, I completed my PhD at the University of California, Berkeley and taught in the Persian Gulf for five years, first at Qatar University and then at New York University Abu Dhabi. At NYU Abu Dhabi, I co-founded OpenGulf, a set of interconnected digital projects focusing on historical documentation about the Gulf region.",

        "intro": "I am a historian of the twentieth century United States working at the intersection of intellectual, political, and cultural history, with a particular interest in ideas about the state, markets, and capitalism and how these play out in policy and politics.  My most recent book is Milton Friedman: The Last Conservative, the first full biography of the influential economist and political figure.  My first book, Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right (Oxford, 2009), was an intellectual biography of the libertarian novelist Ayn Rand.  For more on this book, watch my interviews with Jon Stewart  and Steven Colbert, or check out my website.  I have published articles about the history of conservatism, libertarianism, and liberalism in a number of academic and popular journals, including Reviews in American History, Modern Intellectual History, Journal of Cultural Economy, The New York Times, The New Republic, and Dissent.   In 2024-25 academic year, I will be teaching the following undergraduate courses:Fall 2024History 154B: American Intellectual History, 1900-present (lecture class)History 269/369: Thinking About Capitalism (discussion class – limited enrollment)Winter 2025College 102 (Citizenship): Monday/Wednesday 1:30-2:50 (limited enrollmentIn Spring 2025, I will be teaching in the Bing Overseas Program, Santiago, ChileI'm currently faculty advisor to the new Stanford Humanities Center Workshop in Religion, Politics, and Culture and am a founding faculty member of the American Religions in a Global Context interdisciplinary hub/graduate certificate.    To prospective graduate students: unless otherwise noted here, I will be reading applications for the upcoming fall admissions cycle.  I am able to serve as a primary advisor, and will also work with all admitted graduate students in a supportive capacity.  Due to the volume of inquiries, I'm generally not able to meet or correspond with prospective students, however I always enjoy hearing from students who are interested in working with me.  Please read the information on this page carefully.Generally, I can advise a range of twentieth century topics, but my expertise is intellectual, political, and cultural history, with a particular interest in the history of American politics, economic thought, religion, and capitalism.   Thankfully, Stanford’s archival collections in these areas are particularly rich, making it possible to explore a range of possible dissertation topics without leaving campus.  If you are admitted to our program, you will be invited to campus and will have a chance to meet with me, other faculty, and current students. I am also available to mentor students pursuing a J.D./Ph.D.  For more information on this program, please visit the website of Stanford's Center for Law and History.In the meantime, please read carefully the materials about our program on our website, which should answer most questions.  In your application, be sure to list me as a potential mentor and explain why you think our areas of interest overlap.  You do not need to have identified a potential dissertation topic, although you can indicate potential ideas.  Your \"personal statement\"  should not be a personal essay, but rather should describe the intellectual journey that led you to graduate school, referencing specific books, courses, professors, and research experiences.  If you were not an undergraduate history major, explain why history is your chosen discipline and the academic experiences that have prepared you for graduate study.  If you are applying for the joint J.D./PhD., be sure to explain why this program fits your particular interests.A polished writing sample using primary sources, high grades in history courses, and supportive letters from instructors who know you well are the most important parts of your application.  There is no minimum GRE score requirement.  Be aware that admissions decisions in our department are made collectively.  This means your application must appeal not only to me, but to my colleagues.  Therefore your application needs to show evidence of a certain level of professional development: that you understand primary source research and historiography and are interested in the general sweep of American history, not just your specific corner of research.  Interests often change and develop during graduate school, so the admissions committee is looking for a certain quality of mind, rather than a specific topic.  That said, definitely describe your research interests as you currently understand them, and how you see your approach opening up new ways of understanding the past.  Applicants to the J.D./Ph.D., program must apply and gain entrance separately to the history department and the law school.Finally, I request that all prospective applicants familiarize themselves with the realities of the academic job market in history.  Due to a contraction in the number of history faculty being hired, securing tenure-track employment has become extremely difficult, no matter your qualifications or accomplishments. The latest data is here.A Stanford specific study, including placement rates for history Ph.D graduates through 2013, can be found here.   Note that the Stanford data do not distinguish between tenure track and adjunct positions.   For a caution on graduate student debt, which can significantly impair your future happiness, click here.  While I will work assiduously to help all my advisees gain academic employment, I also encourage and support all students in considering a broad range of careers paths possible with a doctorate in history.",

Cabrita shows that Twala’s posthumous obscurity has been no accident, charting how White scholars and politicians used racial and gendered prejudices to erase Twala’s work and claim her uncompensated intellectual labor for themselves. \nCabrita has also investigated the transnational networks of the Southern African region including those which connect Southern Africans to the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans. Her book (The People’s Zion: Southern Africa, the United States and a Transatlantic Faith-Healing Movement, Harvard University Press, 2018) investigates the convergence of evangelical piety, transnational networks, and the rise of industrialized societies in both Southern Africa and North America. The People's Zion was awarded the American Society of Church History's Albert C Outler Prize for 2019. She is also the co-editor of a volume examining the global dimensions of Christian practice, advocating for a shift away from Western Christianity to the lateral connections connecting southern hemisphere religious practitioners (Relocating World Christianity, Brill, 2017).\n\nCabrita has a long-standing interest in how Southern Africans used and transformed a range of old and new media forms. Her first book (Text and Authority in the South African Nazaretha Church, Cambridge University Press, 2014) investigates the print culture of a large South African religious organization, while her edited collection (Religion, Media and Marginality in Africa, Ohio University Press, 2018) focuses on the intersection of media, Islam, Christianity and political expression in modern Africa.\n\nCabrita did her PhD at the University of Cambridge and was subsequently a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge. Before moving to Stanford, she held permanent posts at SOAS (University of London) and the University of Cambridge. Her research has been recognized by two major early-career research prizes, the British Arts and Humanities Early Career Research Fellowship (2015) and the Philip Leverhulme Prize (2017). In 2023, Cabrita was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Uppsala.\nCabrita’s work has been featured in The Guardian, The Conversation, Lit Hub, History Today, the BBC World Service, and NPR, amongst other venues.",

        "intro": "J. P. Daughton is Professor of History, and Professor (by courtesy) of French and Italian. He is a historian of Europe, imperialism and colonialism, and global history. His teaching and publications explore political, cultural, social, and environmental history, as well as the modern history of religion, technology, and humanitarianism. His affiliations at Stanford include the Europe Center, the Center for African Studies, and the Center for Human Rights and International Justice. His most recent book, In the Forest of No Joy: The Congo-Océan Railroad and the Tragedy of French Colonialism (W. W. Norton, 2021), tells the story of one of the deadliest construction projects in history. Between 1921 and 1934, French colonial interests recruited -- most often by force -- more than 100,000 men, women, and children to work on a 500-kilometer stretch of rail between Brazzaville and the Atlantic Coast. In the end, tens of thousands of Africans were dead, killed by mistreatment, starvation, and disease. The book painstakingly recounts the experiences of local communities in the face of colonial economic development, considers why the railroad witnessed such extraordinary violence and suffering, and explores how the rhetoric of \"civilization\" and \"development\" were used to justify the loss of so many African lives. In the Forest of No Joy was shortlisted for the Cundill History Prize and a finalist for the American Library in Paris Book Prize. A French translation is forthcoming with Éditions du Seuil.Daughton is also the author of An Empire Divided: Religion, Republicanism, and the Making of French Colonialism, 1880-1914 (Oxford University Press, 2006), a book that tells the story of how troubled relations between Catholic missionaries and a host of republican critics shaped colonial policies, Catholic perspectives, and domestic French politics in the decades before the First World War. Based on archival research from four continents, the book challenges the long-held view that French colonizing and “civilizing” goals were the product of a distinctly secular republican ideology built on Enlightenment ideals. A CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title, An Empire Divided was awarded the George Louis Beer Prize for the best book in international history from the American Historical Association, as well as the Alf Andrew Heggoy Book Prize from the French Colonial Historical Society. He is also the editor, with Owen White, of In God’s Empire: French Missionaries in the Modern World (Oxford University Press, 2012), a collection of essays on the role played by French religious workers in the empire and beyond. His essays and reviews, on themes related to colonial violence, international governance, informal empire, and cultural policy, have appeared in publications like the Journal of Modern History, the American Historical Review, and French Historical Studies. Daughton’s PhD advisees have written on a wide range of subjects, from nineteenth-century French cultural policies to the history of famine, and from alcohol consumption and violence in the First World War to the work of international NGOs in Algeria during decolonization. He is currently accepting graduate students interested in transnational history, modern Europe, empire, humanitarianism, international politics, and environment history.",

Much of my research tries to understand how law and society interact with each other, especially where legal norms conflict with social practices. Another strand of my research explores the history of economic life and economic thought, especially medieval debates over usury and moneylending. I have also written on the circulation of goods, people, and ideas in the medieval Mediterranean.My first book (No Return: Jews, Christian Usurers, and the Spread of Mass Expulsion in Medieval Europe, Princeton University Press) uses the banishment of Jewish and Christian moneylenders to explore the rise of mass expulsion as a widespread practice in the later Middle Ages. The book was awarded the 2023 Salo Baron Prize from the American Academy for Jewish Research; the 2024 Wallace K. Ferguson Prize from the Canadian Historical Association; the 2023 Margaret Wade Labarge Prize from the Canadian Society of Medievalists; and the 2024 American Historical Association Pacific Coast Branch Book Award.A second ongoing project examines the ways in which medieval canon law was adapted, reinterpreted, or resisted in local contexts in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The latter builds on Corpus Synodalium, a prize-winning full-text database of late medieval local ecclesiastical legislation that I have been developing since 2016, with assistance from colleagues around the world.Born and raised in western Canada, I did my undergraduate and doctoral work at Harvard University, earning an MPhil in Medieval History from the University of Cambridge along the way.

        "intro": "I have taught the early history of science and medicine for many years on the premise that one of the most important ways to understand how science, medicine and technology have become so central to contemporary society comes from examining the process by which scientific knowledge emerged. I also take enormous pleasure in examining a kind of scientific knowledge that did not have an autonomous existence from other kinds of creative endeavors, but emerged in the context of humanistic approaches to the world (in defiance of C.P. Snow's claim that the modern world is one of \"two cultures\" that share very little in common). More generally, I am profoundly attracted to individuals in the past who aspired to know everything. It still seems like a worthy goal.\n\nMy other principal interest lies in understanding the world of the Renaissance, with a particular focus on Italy. I continue to be fascinated by a society that made politics, economics and culture so important to its self-definition, and that obviously succeeded in all these endeavors for some time, as the legacy of such figures as Machiavelli and Leonardo suggests. Renaissance Italy, in short, is a historical laboratory for understanding the possibilities and the problems of an innovative society. As such, it provides an interesting point of comparison to Gilded Age America, where magnates such as J.P. Morgan often described themselves as the \"new Medici,\" and to other historical moments when politics, art and society combined fruitfully.\n\nI have a certain interest in the relations between gender, culture and knowledge. Virginia Woolf rightfully observed at the beginning of the twentieth century that one could go to a library and find a great deal about women but very little that celebrated or supported their accomplishments. This is no longer true a century later, in large part thanks to the efforts of many scholars, male and female, who have made the work of historical women available to modern readers and who have begun to look at relations between the sexes in more sophisticated ways. Our own debates and disagreements on such issues make this subject all the more important to understand.\n\nIn addition to my work in the History Department, I currently direct Stanford's ESF (Education as Self Fashioning) Program for entering freshmen (https://sis.stanford.edu/education-self-fashioning-esf) and am also Faculty Director of Stanford's MLA (Masters in Liberal Arts) Program (https://mla.stanford.edu/), an evening masters program for adults who want an interdisciplinary learning community in which to cultivate their intellectual passions.  All this is to say that I enjoy working with students at all levels.  Prospective PhD students might enjoy reading my thoughts on getting a doctorate: https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-go-to-grad-school/\n\nIn recent years, I have worked with colleagues from Notre Dame, Princeton, and Stanford to offer the Rome Archive Seminar, a funded opportunity for graduate students who want to learn how to use the Roman libraries and archives for their doctoral research: https://rome.nd.edu/research/projects-activities/rome-seminar/\n\nDuring summers, I also teach in Pioneer Academics, a research program for high school students who want to learn about the history of science as well as the experience of developing a college-level research paper: https://pioneeracademics.com/",

        "intro": "Jonathan Gienapp is Associate Professor of History and Associate Professor of Law. He specializes in the constitutional, political, legal, and intellectual history of the early United States. His primary focus to date has been the origins and development of the U.S. Constitution, in particular the ways in which Founding-era Americans understood and debated constitutionalism across the nation's early decades. His historical interests often intersect with modern legal debates over constitutional interpretation and theory, especially those centered on the theory of constitutional originalism. He is also especially interested in the method and practice of the history of ideas.His first book, The Second Creation: Fixing the American Constitution in the Founding Era (Harvard University Press, Belknap, 2018), rethinks the conventional story of American constitutional creation by exploring how and why founding-era Americans’ understanding of their Constitution transformed in the earliest years of the document’s existence. It investigates how early political debates over the Constitution’s meaning altered how Americans imagined the Constitution and its possibilities, showing how these changes created a distinct kind of constitutional culture, the consequences of which endure to this day. It won the 2017 Thomas J. Wilson Memorial Prize from Harvard University Press and the 2019 Best Book in American Political Thought Award from the American Political Science Association and was a finalist for the 2019 Frederick Jackson Turner Award from the Organization of American Historians. In addition, it was named a Choice Outstanding Academic Title for 2019 and a Spectator USA Book of the Year for 2018. It was reviewed in The Nation, was the subject of a symposium at Balkinization, and was chosen for the 2019 Publius Symposium co-hosted by the Stanford Constitutional Law Center and the Stanford Center for Law and History. He wrote about some of the book's central themes in an op-ed for the Boston Globe, and has discussed the book on \"New Books in History,\" \"The Age of Jackson Podcast,\" \"Law's Dimensions,\" and \"Riches & Power,\" as well as in interviews for Current and the Harvard University Press Blog.Connected to his work in constitutional history, Gienapp has written extensively on the relationship between history and constitutional originalism. His second book, Against Constitutional Originalism: A Historical Critique, to be published by Yale University Press in fall of 2024, presents a comprehensive historical critique of originalism. It argues that recovering Founding-era constitutionalism on its own terms fundamentally challenges originalists' unspoken assumptions about the U.S. Constitution and its original meaning. For a preview, see his article, \"Written Constitutionalism, Past and Present,\" published in Law and History Review, which was identified as one of the best works of recent scholarship in constitutional law in a review at Jotwell. He has written two essays on originalism and history that have been widely cited that appeared on Process: A Blog for American History, published by the Organization of American Historians. His work on originalism has been featured in The New York Times. Related to these endeavors, he is a member of the Historians Council on the Constitution at the Brennan Center for Justice and has contributed to a number of historians' amicus briefs to the Supreme Court of the United States.Gienapp has also written on a range of related topics pertaining to early American constitutionalism, politics, and intellectual history, modern constitutional interpretation, and the study of the history of ideas. He has published articles and book chapters in a host of venues, including the Journal of the Early Republic, Law and History Review, The New England Quarterly, and Constitutional Commentary. He co-organized, and contributed to, a symposium for the Fordham Law Review entitled \"The Federalist Constitution\" that explores the oft-overlooked constitutional ideas of the nationalist-minded politicians and jurists who initially held power and influence at the time of the Constitution's creation.Gienapp is currently writing a book on the forgotten history of the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution, currently entitled \"We the People of the United States: The Struggle over Popular Sovereignty and Nationhood.\" It tells the story of the Preamble's early vitality and eventual descent into political and legal irrelevance as a way of exploring the broader struggle over popular sovereignty and national union in the early United States. It probes the often entwined debates over popular rule, sovereignty, federalism, and constitutionalism in the nation's earliest years to understand the full meanings of the Constitution's opening words: \"We the People of the United States.\" Central to this project is the recovery of a distinct, yet forgotten, vision of constitutionalism that predominated at the American Founding and treated the Preamble as the central feature of the Constitution. It was most vigorously championed by the leading constitutional framers, James Wilson and Gouverneur Morris. Even though Wilson and Morris are largely unknown today, no two delegates to the Constitutional Convention played a more significant role in shaping the final Constitution, and in the years immediately following the Convention their particular conception of the Constitution was influential. Over the course of subsequent decades, however, their vision was quietly supplanted and largely pushed underground. Nonetheless, it reverberated for years to come, motivating abolitionists and other political activists eager to harness constitutional power to change an American order they deemed deeply unjust. Bringing this vision of the Constitution back into focus and understanding both its original vitality as well as how and why it disappeared offers an unfamiliar and revealing account of early U.S. constitutionalism, one that invites us to look upon the Preamble to the Constitution anew.Gienapp has lectured widely on the U.S. Constitution and the American Founding era. Among other appearances, he discussed the Constitution's history in an episode of the podcast, \"Writ Large,\" participated in a National Constitution Center Town Hall, \"The Founders' Library: Intellectual Sources of the Constitution,\" and a Constitution Day discussion of the Constitutional Convention, discussed James Wilson's contributions to U.S. constitutionalism in a webinar hosted by the James Wilson Institute on Natural Rights and the American Founding, was interviewed about the history of election disputes in the United States for The New York Times, and discussed the history of minority rule in the United States on NPR's All Things Considered. He also helped compile the National Constitution Center's Founders' Library.In addition to his appointments in the History department and at Stanford Law School, Gienapp is a member of the Stanford Civics Initiative.Gienapp is accepting graduate students to the Ph.D. program in History who are interested in working on all aspects of early American history and U.S. constitutional and legal history, including especially those students interested in Stanford's J.D./Ph.D. program in law and history.

In addition, he is a professor of political science, professor of history, and professor of economics (by courtesy).\n\nHaber has spent his career investigating why the world distribution of income so uneven. His papers have been published in economics, history, political science, and law journals.\nHe is the author of five books and the editor of six more. Haber’s most recent books include Fragile by Design with Charles Calomiris (Princeton University Press), which examines how governments and industry incumbents often craft banking regulatory policies in ways that stifle competition and increase systemic risk. The Battle Over Patents (Oxford University Press), a volume edited with Naomi Lamoreaux, documents the development of US-style patent systems and the political fights that have shaped them.\n\nHis latest project focuses on a long-standing puzzle in the social sciences: why are prosperous democracies not randomly distributed across the planet, but rather, are geographically clustered? Haber and his coauthors answer this question by using geospatial tools to simulate the ecological conditions that shaped pre-industrial food production and trade. They then employ machine learning methods to elucidate the relationship between ecological conditions and the levels of economic development that emerged across the globe over the past three centuries.\n\nHaber holds a Ph.D. in history from UCLA and has been on the Stanford faculty since 1987. From 1995 to 1998, he served as associate dean for the social sciences and director of Graduate Studies of Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences.

He is broadly concerned with the causes and consequences of inequality, its relationship to various markets, and when, how, and why African Americans organized collectively to challenge systems of domination.  \n\nHis first book, The Bonds of Inequality: Debt and the Making of the American City (University of Chicago Press, 2021), won the Ellis W. Hawley Prize and James A. Rawley Prize from the Organization of American Historians (2022), the 2022 Kenneth Jackson Award for Best Book in North American Urban History, and was a finalist for the 2022 best new book in African American History and Culture from the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.\n\nHe is also co-editor of Histories of Racial Capitalism (Columbia University Press, 2021), which brings together scholars across a range of disciplines to revisit the persistent question of the relationship between race and capitalism. \n\nHis writings have appeared in the Washington Post, The Nation, and the New York Times. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the American Historical Review.  \n\nDestin Jenkins is working to two projects. The first is a concise history of debt in America (W.W. Norton). The second project weaves together three intersecting stories. The first concerns the rise of Black political representation in cities across America in the wake of the civil rights revolution. The second story is about the underground economy. The final story concerns privatization in and of local government. By grounding these accounts in granular, humdrum matters of revenues, expenditures, debt, and administration, the book expands the boundaries of African American history and carceral studies, and contributes to histories of capitalism and American political development.\n\nBefore joining the faculty at Stanford, he was the Neubauer Family Assistant Professor of History at the University of Chicago. He has held fellowships at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, and the Robert L. Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies at The New School. \n\nJenkins offers courses on the history of capitalism, comparative race and ethnicity, African American politics, urban/suburban history, crime and punishment, and U.S. historiography.",

        "intro": "I became interested in Russia at the height of the Cold War and initially studied Russia and Russian with an eye to the foreign service. History lured me way, especially after spending a junior semester at Leningrad State University in 1970 and having the chance to travel around the Soviet Union a bit. In graduate research and since coming to Stanford in 1982, I have focused on the early modern period (from the fourteenth century through the eighteenth). In almost all my work I have been explored the question of how politics worked in an autocracy. Theoretically I am interested in how early modern states, particularly empires, tried to create, at best, social cohesion and, at least, stability, by ritual, ideology, law and the measured use of violence. My early research focused on structures of power at the Kremlin court and the influence of kinship and marriage in politics and on social values from Muscovy to the Enlightenment (Kinship and Politics: The Making of the Muscovite Political System 1987); these themes encouraged my abiding interest in the roles of women in political ideology and practice. I have written two books on legal culture, one on disputes over honor (By Honor Bound 1999) and one on the practice of the criminal law (Crime and Punishment in Early Modern Russia 2012). Here I’ve contrasted the letter of the law with the workings of local courts, how people used the law, how judges and other officials played roles in the system, how the law was written and interpreted. In all this I’ve tried to place Russia in a comparative context where appropriate, trying to break down clichés of Russia being fundamentally different from European history or unknowable. \n\nMy current work goes in several directions. One is a turn to the visual -- I have written several articles on the production and use in Russia of icons, frescos and miniatures as a medium for political communication. I am now finishing up a project on images of Russia produced by foreign engravers in early print publications and maps. The tension in these images between stock tropes of the engraver's trade and eye-witness information, is one fascinating aspect; another is the challenge to assess the impact of text and image on the reader. All in all, I have found that most illustrated works about Russia present a more nuanced understanding than the image of “despotism” that has caught a lot of scholarly attention. Finally, I am interested in how Russia functioned as an empire. I recently published a synthetic history (The Russian Empire 1450-1801 2017) of Russia as a “Eurasian politics of different empire,” and I plan to follow up this theme and return to the practice of the law by studying the implementation of Catherine II’s judicial reforms (1775) in the non-Russian provinces.",

        "intro": "Mark Edward Lewis’s research deals with many aspects of Chinese civilization in the late pre-imperial, early imperial and middle periods (contemporary with the centuries in the West from classical Greece through the early Middle Ages), and with the problem of empire as a political and social form.His first book, Sanctioned Violence in Early China, studies the emergence of the first Chinese empires by examining the changing forms of permitted violence—warfare, hunting, sacrifice, punishments, and vengeance.  It analyzes the interlinked evolution of these violent practices to reveal changes in the nature of political authority, in the units of social organization, and in the defining practices and attitudes of the ruling elites.  It thus traces the changes that underlay the transformation of the Chinese polity from a league of city-states dominated by aristocratic lineages to a unified, territorial state governed by a supreme autocrat and his agents.His second book, Writing and Authority in Early China covers the same period from a different angle.  It traces the evolving uses of writing to command assent and obedience, an evolution that culminated in the establishment of a textual canon as the foundation of imperial authority.  The book examines the full range of writings employed in early China, including divinatory records, written communications with ancestors, government documents, collective writings of philosophical traditions, speeches attributed to historical figures, chronicles, verse anthologies, commentaries, and encyclopedic compendia.  It shows how these writings in different ways served to form social groups, administer populations, control officials, invent new models of intellectual and political authority, and create an artificial language whose mastery generated power and whose graphs become potent, almost magical, objects.His third book, The Construction of Space in Early China, examines the formation of the Chinese empire through its reorganization and reinterpretation of its basic spatial units: the human body, the household, the city, the region, and the world.  It shows how each higher unit—culminating in the empire—claimed to incorporate and transcend the units of the preceding level, while in practice remaining divided and constrained by the survival of the lower units, whose structures and tensions they reproduced.  A companion volume, The Flood Myths of Early China, shows how these early Chinese ideas about the constituent elements of an ordered, human space—along with the tensions and divisions therein—were elaborated and dramatized in a set of stories about the re-creation of a structured world from a watery chaos that had engulfed it.His fifth monograph, Honor and Shame in Early China, traces evolving ideas about honor and shame in the Warring States and early empires in order to understand major developments in the social history of the period. It examines the transformation of elites and the emergence of new groups through scrutinizing differing claims to “honor” (and consequent re-definitions of what was “shameful”) entailed in claiming a public role without necessarily being a noble or an employee of the state. In addition to these specialist monographs, Lewis has written the first three volumes of a six-volume survey of the entire history of imperial China: The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han, China Between Empires: The Northern and Southern Dynasties, and China’s Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty.  These volumes serve as introductions to the major periods of Chinese history for non-specialists, and as background readings to introductory surveys.  In addition to recounting the major political events, they devote chapters to the most important aspects of the society of each period: geographic background, cities, rural society, kinship, religion, literature, and law.He created the Chinese Texts course, which is intended to teach students how to read Classical Chinese philosophy and history. The course uses texts from the Warring States and Early Han period, provides detailed analysis of the passages and how the translation was reached, and explains the uses of parallelism and rhythmic patterns in Classical Chinese.",

Though these “black sites” exist out of view for the average American, their reach extends into all of our lives: the explosive growth of the for-profit prison industry traces its origins to the immigrant detention system, as does the emergence of Guantanamo and the gradual unraveling of the right to bail and the presumption of innocence. Through these narratives, we see how the changing political climate surrounding immigration has played out in individual lives, and at what cost. But as these stories demonstrate, it doesn’t have to be like this, and a better way might be possible.Additionally, Minian has published articles in the Journal of American History, American Quarterly, and American Historical Review. In 2020, Minian was awarded with the prestigious Andrew Carnegie Fellowship.Minian's third book project, \"No Man’s Lands: A New History of Immigration Restriction,\" examines how during the late Cold War and its aftermath, U.S. officials created new spaces and territories designed to prevent Latin American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean migrants from entering the United States. Rather than a thought-out and coherent project, these various spatial enterprises were designed haphazardly in response to particular incidents and migrations.Prospective graduate students: if you want to work with me please mark Latin America as your primary geographic field of interest in your application. Once you are in the program you can choose any primary field you want based on your (changing) interests.",

        "intro": "I joined the department in 2006 after I completed my dissertation on the last phase of Korean reformist movements and the Japanese colonization of Korea between 1896 and 1910. In my dissertation, I revisited the identity of the pro-Japanese collaborators, called the Ilchinhoe, and highlighted the tensions between their populist orientation and the state-centered approach of the Japanese colonizers. Examining the Ilchinhoe’s reformist orientation and their dissolution by the Japanese authority led me to question what it meant to be collaborators during the period and what their tragic history tells us about empire as a political entity. I am currently working on a book manuscript centered on the theme of collaboration and empire, notably in relation to the recent revisionist assessments of empire. My next research will extend to the colonial period of Korea after the annexation and will examine what constituted colonial modernity in people’s everyday lives and whether the particulars of modernity were different in colonial and non-colonial situations. To explore these questions, I plan to look at the history of movie theaters in East Asia between 1890 and 1945, a subject which will allow me to study the interactions between the colonial authority, capitalists and consumers, as well as to look at the circulation of movies as consumed texts.",

        "intro": "I am an historian of the nineteenth-century United States,  interested in the antebellum South, Greater Caribbean, slavery, capitalism, and disease. I am a 2024 recipient of the Dan David Prize, the world’s largest prize for practitioners studying the human past.My first book, Necropolis: Disease, Power, and Capitalism in the Cotton Kingdom (Harvard University Press, Belknap imprint, 2022) concerns yellow fever, immunity, and inequality . During the nineteenth-century, epidemic yellow fever struck New Orleans every second or third summer, killing up to ten percent of the city’s population. This virus was shrouded in mystery. There was no cure, no inoculation, no conclusive evidence of disease transmission, and no satisfactory explanation for why it killed some while leaving others healthy. It was, moreover, a sudden and miserable way to die, with victims vomiting up partly coagulated blood, roughly the consistency and color of coffee grounds. The only way to protect oneself from the scourge was to bet “acclimated,” that is fall sick with the disease, survive, and gain lifetime immunity. About half of all people died in the acclimating process. In time, a disease hierarchy--what I term immunocapitalism--developed: the city became stratified between those whites who possessed immunity to yellow fever (the “acclimated”), those who remained vulnerable to the virus (the “unacclimated”), and those whose immunity status could only socially and economically benefit others (Black slaves and most free people of color). Disease was therefore no great leveler. Rather it heightened inequality in an already violent and unequal slave society. Necropolis received numerous awards. These include: the 2023 Frederick Jackson Turner Award for the Best First Book in American History from the Organization of American Historians; the 2023 Prize in American History from the American Historical Association (formerly the Dunning Prize), awarded biennially for the best first or second book in US history; the 2023 Simkins Prize from the Southern Historical Association; the 2023 Broussard Prize from the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic; the 2023 Kemper and Leila William Prize for the Best Book in Louisiana History from the Louisiana Historical Association and the Historic New Orleans Collection; the 2023 PROSE Award for Excellence in Humanities from the Association of American Publishers; and the 2023 Humanities Book of the Year Award, Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities.I am also interested in historical notions of consent (sexual or otherwise); syphilis and shame in the American Civil War and Gilded Age; slave revolts in the United States and the Caribbean; anti- and pro-slavery thought; class and ethnicity in antebellum America; the history of life insurance and environmental risk; comparative slave systems; technology and slavery; the Haitian Revolution; and boosterism in the American West.Born and raised in New York, Washington D.C., and London, I earned my BA in history (cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) from Yale University in 2011. I received an MSt in US History (with distinction) in 2013 and a DPhil in History in 2017 from the University of Oxford. Before joining the Stanford faculty, I was a Past and Present postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Historical Research at the University of London.I am accepting graduate students who are interested in all aspects of early/nineteenth-century United States history.",

She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Professor Schiebinger received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1984 and is a leading international authority on gender in science and technology. Over the past thirty years, Schiebinger's work has been devoted to teasing apart three analytically distinct but interlocking pieces of the gender and science puzzle: the history of women's participation in science; gender in the structure of scientific institutions; and the gendering of human knowledge.Londa Schiebinger presented the keynote address and wrote the conceptual background paper for the United Nations' Expert Group Meeting on Gender, Science, and Technology, September 2010 in Paris. She presented the findings at the United Nations in New York, February 2011 with an update spring 2014. The UN Resolutions of March 2011 call for \"gender-based analysis ... in science and technology\" and for the integrations of a \"gender perspective in science and technology curricula.\" Again in 2022, she prepared the background paper for the United Nations 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women’s priority theme, Innovation and Technological Change, and Education in the Digital Age for Achieving Gender Equality and The Empowerment of all Women and Girls. Since 2023, Gendered Innovations has been a member of the UNFPA Equity 2030 Alliance. In 2011-2014, Schiebinger entered into major collaborations with the European Commission and the U.S. National Science Foundation to promote Gendered Innovations in Science, Health & Medicine, Engineering, and Environment. This project draws experts from across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia, and was presented at the European Parliament, July 2013 as Gendered Innovations: How Gender Analysis Contributes to Research. In 2018-2020, Schiebinger directed the European Commission Expert Group to produce Gendered Innovations 2: How Inclusive Analysis Contributes to Research and Innovation. Institutes for Gendered Innovations research opened in Soeul, South Korea, in 2015 and in Tokyo, Japan, in 2022.Schiebinger has addressed the Korean National Assembly (2014).

But Should They be Gendered? (2019). Schiebinger served as a member of the Faculty Planning Committee for the Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute. Schiebinger's work in the eighteenth century investigates the circulation of knowledge in the Atlantic World. In particular she explores medical experimentation with enslaved populations in the Caribbean. Her Secret Cures of Slaves: People, Plants, and Medicine in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World reconceptualizes research in four areas: first and foremost knowledge of African contributions to early modern science; the historiography of race in science; the history of human experimentation; and the role of science in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world. Her prize-winning Plants and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World investigates women's indigenous knowledge of abortifacients and why this knowledge did not travel. Londa Schiebinger has been the recipient of numerous prizes and awards, including the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize and John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. Schiebinger has just been appointed a Distinguished Affiliated Professor at the Technische Universität, Münichen, and member of their Institute for Advanced Studies. She has also served as a Senior Research Fellow at the Max-Planck-Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte in Berlin, the Jantine Tammes Chair in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Groningen, a guest professor at the Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen, and the Maria Goeppert-Meyer Distinguished Visitor, Oldenburg University. Her research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, National Endowment for the Humanities, Rockefeller Foundation, Fulbright-Hays Commission, Woodrow Wilson Foundation, and Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst.Londa Schiebinger was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (2013), the Faculty of Science, Lund University, Sweden (2017), and the University of Valencia, Spain (2018); the Berlin Falling Walls Breakthrough Winner in Science & Innovation Management (2022); the Interdisciplinary Leadership Award from Women's Health at Stanford Medical School, 2010; Prize in Atlantic History from the American Historical Association, 2005 and the Alf Andrew Heggoy Book Prize from the French Colonial Historical Society, 2005, both for her Plants and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World.

        "intro": "I am an historian of modern South Asia, specializing in nineteenth and early twentieth century eastern India, with a developing research interest in the late eighteenth century. My work is located at the intersection of the fields of histories of state formation and labour history. I am particularly interested in the histories of government workers and how this labour history intrinsic to the state apparatus recasts our understanding of state formation.\nI am currently working on the manuscript of my first book, provisionally entitled Sovereign Labour: Constables and Watchmen in the Making of the Modern State in India, c. 1860-1950. This monograph is a study of police constables and village watchmen in Bengal from the promulgation of the Police Act in 1861 until the upheavals of decolonisation in the mid-twentieth century. It reframes the history of constables and village watchmen, usually represented as government functionaries, as the history of a distinctive form of labour. \nThe most important methodological innovation of this study is to bring methods from the historiography of labour in South Asia in conversation with the vast archive of the colonial police and to demonstrate how we can rewrite police history as labour history. Sovereign Labour charts the contours of the market of security labour in eastern India and locates the emergence of colonial police workforces within the rhythms of this labour market. It reveals the patterns in the history of constabulary recruitment; examines the implications of the conditions of police work for the nature of police power; delineates the internal segmentation within the world of police labour, and the defining role of caste in shaping modern policing apparatuses in colonial India; and brings out fresh evidence about the myriad modes of politics devised by police workers in this region. More broadly, my aim is to clear a conceptual ground for the study of forms of labour within the apparatuses of the modern state as well as demonstrate how the history of the labouring lives of government workers can provide a fresh entry point into the nature of the modern state in South Asia.\nBefore joining Stanford, I was a Junior Research Fellow in History at Trinity College, Cambridge.",

        "intro": "Professor Twitty is a historian of the nineteenth-century United States with a particular focus on law and legal culture, slavery and freedom, and the history of the South and Midwest. She is also a public historian interested in understanding slavery and its legacy at institutions of higher learning and Confederate memory and memorialization.Her first book, Before Dred Scott: Slavery and Legal Culture in the American Confluence, 1787-1857, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2016. It draws upon a remarkable collection of nearly 300 freedom suits filed in the St. Louis circuit court to examine the legal history of slavery and freedom in the American Confluence, a site where portions of present day Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri meet. In this fluid region, it argues, ordinary people—including masters, slaves, indentured servants, and all those they came into contact with—developed a distinctive legal culture characterized by a sophisticated and widespread knowledge of formal law, the hallmark of which was the landmark United States Supreme Court case Scott v. Sandford. You can listen to Professor Twitty discuss this research on podcasts with New Books Network and the Institute for Justice’s Bound by Oath episode on “John Rock and the Birth of Birthright Citizenship.”She is currently pursuing two new book projects. The first examines the multiple forms of unfreedom that persisted across the putatively “free North” in the first half of the nineteenth century. The second explores the strange career of ratification in the making of state constitutions.Professor Twitty has also been active in efforts to study and contextualize the practice of slavery on college campuses generally and at the University of Mississippi, specifically. A founding member of the University of Mississippi Slavery Research Group, she has presented her own research on student slaveholding wealth and the memory of Reconstruction at the University of Mississippi, represented the UMSRG at national conferences, advised UMSRG graduate student researchers, and helped establish a campus slavery tour program. Professor Twitty has likewise worked to help the University of Mississippi confront its racially divisive past. In the Spring of 2016 she was at the forefront of the history department’s efforts to persuade the administration to revise the text on a plaque it had placed in front of the Confederate monument on the University’s campus and co-authored a departmental report detailing the historical context and meaning of the Confederacy and the Confederate monument at the University. She was subsequently appointed to serve on the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on History and Context, which produced a comprehensive set of recommendations about how the University should contextualize important historical sites on campus in the Summer of 2017 and resulted in the creation of six historical markers on campus.As part of her on-going research into the history of the University of Mississippi, Professor Twitty discovered the full text of the address that was given by Mississippian Charles Scott at the 1906 unveiling of the Confederate monument on the University of Mississippi’s campus. This speech was reprinted by the Vicksburg Herald on May 11, 1906, and has been transcribed in full. Professor Twitty subsequently wrote about the discovery and its significance for The Atlantic.Professor Twitty has also served as Secretary for the American Society for Legal History and currently serves on the editorial board of the Journal of American Constitutional History and on board of directors of the Freedom Suits Memorial Foundation.She joined the faculty at Stanford University in the fall of 2023 after teaching at the University of Mississippi and the Kinder Institute for Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri. She holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from The George Washington University and a master’s and doctoral degree in history from Princeton University.",

        "intro": "Caroline Winterer is William Robertson Coe Professor of History and American Studies, and Professor by courtesy of Classics. She specializes in American history before 1900, especially the history of ideas and the history of science.She is the author of five books. Most recently, How the New World Became Old: The Deep Time Revolution in America (Princeton, 2024) shows how the idea of deep time transformed how Americans see their country and themselves. Deep time refers to the idea that Earth is billions of years old and not 6,000 years old, as a literal reading of the Bible might suggest. Over a single century, from the American Revolution to the invention of the automobile, the majority of Americans came to see their ostensibly New World as the oldest world of all. It was a place of primordial natural beauty and wonder, from Yosemite to Niagara Falls. It was also a place of awe, a land once stalked by terrifying beasts, from T. Rex to saber-toothed cats. Over 100 illustrations bring the lost world of ancient America to life, showing how Americans crafted a modern nation built on their ancient land.She is currently editing a book with her Stanford colleague Jessica Riskin entitled The Apes & Us: A Century of Thinking about Humans among the Primates. It brings together leading anthropologists, primatologists, and historians to reflect upon the many ways we’ve explored the human/ape boundary since the Age of Darwin. The book emerges from an exhibit we staged at Stanford in 2024.Other recent books include Time in Maps: From the Age of Discovery to Our Digital Era (Chicago, 2020), edited with her Stanford colleague Karen Wigen. Assembling a group of distinguished historians, cartographers, and art historians, the book explores how maps around the world for the last 500 years have ingeniously handled time in the spatial medium of maps. American Enlightenments: Pursuing Happiness in the Age of Reason (Yale, 2016), reveals how early Americans grappled with the promises of the Enlightenment – how they used new questions about the plants, animals, rocks, politics, religions and peoples of the New World to imagine a new relationship between the present and the past, and to spur far-flung conversations about a better future for all of humanity. Earlier books and articles have explored America's long tradition of looking at the ancient classical world for political, artistic, and cultural inspiration. She received an American Ingenuity Award from the Smithsonian Institution for mapping the social network of Benjamin Franklin. She is currently accepting graduate students.

        "intro": "I am a historian of modern Latin America and the Caribbean focusing on the intersection of social, political, environmental, and technological change. In my scholarship and teaching, I employ interdisciplinary historical methods to explore questions of water control, agrarian reform, and the effects of climate and weather on the process of social revolution.I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in modern Latin American and Caribbean history, historiography and film, history of US-Latin American/Caribbean relations, environmental history of Latin America and the Caribbean and the United States, climate ethics, and water history (see current and past course offerings in sidebar to the right). I am accepting graduate students for fall 2024, but before contacting me, please become familiar with my work. Specific questions engaging with my work and how it relates to your own research interests are more fruitful as a basis for conversation than generally asking to learn more about my work.My first book, Watering the Revolution: An Environmental and Technological History of Agrarian Reform in Mexico (Duke, 2017; winner, 2018 Elinor K. Melville Prize for Latin American Environmental History; short-listed, 2018 María Elena Martínez Prize for Mexican History), investigates how people managed their water—via dams, canals, and groundwater pumps—in a great crucible of the Mexican Revolution of 1910-20, the arid north-central Laguna region. In so doing, it demonstrates how Mexican federal engineers were not merely passive implementers of large-scale state development schemes such as agrarian reform. Instead, to implement the latter, they actively mediated knowledge between state and society, identifying what they thought was technologically possible and predicting its environmental consequences.The book also explains how engineers encountered an intrinsic tension between farmers’ insatiable demand for water and the urgency to conserve it. By closely examining how the Mexican state watered one of the world’s most extensive agrarian reforms, the book tackles an urgent question in the literature on postrevolutionary Mexican state formation, Latin American environmental history and history of technology, and global development studies: how and why do governments persistently deploy invasive technologies for development even when they know those technologies are ecologically unsustainable?To answer this global question, my book integrates environmental and technological history along with social, economic, political, and legal analyses based on extensive research in archival sources, journals, newspapers, and government publications in Mexico and the United States. Using this “envirotechnical” analytical framework, the book uncovers the varied motivations behind the Mexican government’s decision to use invasive and damaging technologies despite knowing they were unsustainable. My book thereby transforms our understanding of human-nature interactions, water policy, and agricultural development in Latin America. As such, it has been reviewed by nearly 30 US and international journals of history, technology studies, agricultural and environmental sciences, and water management.My research on agrarian reform and water management in north central Mexico led me to investigate how weather and geography shaped the process of social revolution and development in Cuba. In my forthcoming book  Climates of Revolution: How Weather and Geography Shaped Cuban Development, 1955-1971, I combine environmental history and historical climatology to argue that extreme weather events such as drought and hurricanes were not merely infrequent external shocks to Cuba, quickly entering and exiting the main anthropocentric stage of its theater of revolution. Instead, these events, along with a diverse geography forged by an archipelago, were long enmeshed in Cuban politics, economics, society, and culture, and thereby shaped the origins and progression of the 1959 revolution in ways largely overlooked by historians.Specifically, the extremely variable climate of the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains simultaneously protected Fidel Castro’s guerrillas from Batista’s army and became a second ‘enemy’ due to the environmental hardship the barbudos (a machista moniker for the guerrillas meaning bearded ones) endured. After 1959, this barbudo experience informed the way the new revolutionary Cuban state weathered the severe effects of the 1961-2 drought and Hurricane Flora in October 1963. As much as the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1963, I argue that these weather events shaped Cuba's developmental path that culminated in the 10 million-ton sugar harvest campaign of 1970 and escalated into a war of words between Cuba and the United States that was intertwined with the larger geopolitical conflict over the Cuban Revolution.",

West.  My first foray into this project will be Theophilus Magruder v. Jacob Vanderpool (1851), a case in which the territorial government enforced an 1844 law banishing African Americans from Oregon.\nI'm also committed to public history.  Before returning to academia, I worked as Historian at the Robert H. Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello.  I have curated or contributed to several exhibitions at Monticello, including The Boisterous Sea of Liberty (2008), Mulberry Row: Landscape of Slavery (2012), and Sally Hemings: A Life (2018).\nI direct of the Center for the Study of the Age of Jefferson at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation at UVA, which supports pre-doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships, workshops, and lectures: https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/age-jefferson\nAlong with Frank Cogliano, Patrick Griffin, and Eliga Gould, I co-edit the series Revolutionary America at UVA Press.\nAt UVA, I teach courses on Jefferson, public history, legal history, and slavery in the Founding Era.\nI'm enthusiastic about working with creative and enterprising grad students, particularly those interested in the era between the American Revolution and the Civil War.  Interested students should contact me directly in the Summer or Fall preceding the UVA application deadline.",

        "intro": "Biography\nS. Max Edelson studies the history of British America and the Atlantic world. His research examines space, place, and culture in colonial North America and the Caribbean.  He is currently researching and writing Ogilby's New World: Geography and Colonization in Restoration America.  This book focuses on one of the most influential work of geography published in the second half of the seventeenth century: John Ogilby's America (London, 1671).  It examines how European geographic knowledge--in text, maps, and other images--circulated among England's ambitious colonial founders as they settled and developed Jamaica, Carolina, New York, and Pennsylvania.  \nHis first book, Plantation Enterprise in Colonial South Carolina (Harvard, 2006) examines the relationship between planters and environment in South Carolina as the key to understanding this repressive, prosperous society and its distinctive economic culture. It shows that although plantations often represent stasis in myths of the Old South, they were in fact dynamic instruments of empire. Plantation Enterprise was awarded the George C. Rogers Prize by the South Carolina Historical Society and the Theodore Saloutos Memorial Award by the Agricultural History Society.  Harvard University Press published a paperback edition of the book in 2011.\nHis second book, The New Map of Empire: How Britain Imagined America Before Independence (Harvard, 2017), describes how Britain used maps and geographic knowledge to reform its American empire in the eighteenth century.  The book follows the surveyors who fanned out across frontier territories--from the frigid coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to tropical islands in the southeastern Caribbean--to make distant spaces legible from London. The schemes of colonial development and control that these maps envsioned, Edelson argues, helped provoke the reisstance that led to the American Revolution. The New Map of Empire features a free companion website with a dynamic digital archive of more than 257 maps and charts discussed in the book. It was a finalist for the George Washington Book Prize in 2017 and received the John Lyman Book Award for U.S. Maritime History by the North American Society for Oceanic History.\nEdelson and Research Professor Bill Ferster were awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Digital Implementation Grant in 2012 to develop MapScholar at UVa's SHANTI (Sciences, Humanities, and Arts Network of Technological Initiatives).  MapScholar is a dynamic visualization tool for historic map collections.  It offers a free, open-source portal that gives scholars the ability to bring together high-resolution map images from a variety of sources, analyze them in rich geospatial contexts, and use them to illustrate new interpretations in the history of cartography.  Edelson received an American Council of Learned Societies Digital Innovation Fellowship in 2010 to begin this digital humanities research.\nEdelson and Professor Christa Dierksheide direct the UVa Early American Seminar, an ongoing research seminar jointly sponsored by the Corcoran Department of History, the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, and the International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello.  The intellectual center of our dynamic graduate program in colonial, Revolutionary, and early national history, the EAS is a community of scholars that includes PhD students, faculty, and visiting researchers who meet regularly to share and critique works in progress.\nEmployment\nProfessor of History, University of Virginia (2018-)\nAssociate Professor of History, University of Virginia (2009-2018)\nAssociate Professor of History, University of Illinois (2007-2009)\nAssistant Professor of History, University of Illinois (2001-2007)\nAssistant Professor of History, College of Charleston (1998-2001)\n \nGRADUATE STUDENTS\nLee B.

        "publications": "Environmental History; My first published monograph entitled The Unsettled Plain: An Environmental History of the Late Ottoman Frontier; Interview with Ottoman History Podcast about The Unsettled Plain; The Unsettled Plain is an environmental history of the late Ottoman countryside, but it also offers a new narrative of the making of the modern Middle East. Çukurova was located near the geographical center of the late Ottoman Empire, and it was critical to Ottoman imperial project from the Tanzimat period onward, as well as the broader commercialization of the Levant. It was long home to communities of Turkish, Arabic, and Kurdish speaking Muslim populations, as well as a large non-Muslim minority of Greek Orthodox and Armenian communities. It is the only region of the Ottoman Empire where the often conflated Alevi and Alawite communities could be found. And with the migration of Muslim refugees of war and conquest in the Russia Caucasus and Crimea, the Balkans, and Crete, the region grew even more ethnolinguistically diverse over the course of the late Ottoman period. Its history thus offers a window onto the making and unmaking of the cosmopolitan societies of the late Ottoman world.; The Unsettled Plain was awarded the Nikki Keddie Book Award by the Middle East Studies Association of North America in 2022.; Reviews of The Unsettled Plain; H-Environment Journal of Interdisciplinary History\nInternational Journal of Middle East Studies; In addition to this monograph, I have published a number of articles, book chapters, and reviews pertaining to the history of the Cilicia region as well as the subjects of environment, disease, and medicine in the late Ottoman Empire.

Pope-Obeda, Mashriq & Mahjar, Vol. 5 No. 2; This research on Ottoman diaspora has centered on an investigative podcast project entitled “Deporting Ottoman Americans.” Each episode examines the story of a deportation case from the US archives involving an Ottoman-born immigrant during the Great Depression and in doing so, elucidates larger themes pertaining to the subjects of race, gender, class, law, and the formation of post-Ottoman diaspora communities in the United States. Research for the series is complete, but production has been on hold since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. So far, 3 of 13 scheduled episodes have been released.; Episode 3 - Turkino; Public Humanities; Since 2011, I have been producer of Ottoman History Podcast, a collaborative internet radio program featuring interviews with students and scholars. I began working on the podcast with fellow graduate students at Georgetown University to create a new venue for publicly discussing topics of emerging interest concerning the Ottoman Empire, the modern Middle East, and the Islamic world. Since then, I have worked with dozens of team members to produce episodes roughly one a week, totaling more than 500 as of July 2021. I enjoy using the platform as a space of collaboration and to learn about new topics in my area of specialty as well as explore areas beyond my expertise. This playlist contains a complete catalog of my interviews, which total more than 200 to date.; In recent years, I have tried to move beyond the standard interview format to develop well-produced episodes that take full advantage of the podcast medium using sound production and composition techniques influenced by radio journalism. These episodes have extensively employed music and other sonic elements. A few recent examples are below.; The Making of the Islamic World; In Fall 2020, I collaborated with 20 colleagues to produce a 10-part podcast about the history of the Islamic world; Click here for more information about the development of the Ottoman History Podcast and our team.",

        "intro": "Biography\nMy research explores the intersection of African American history, American economic history, and the history of American slavery.  Specifically, I look at slavery’s influence on the evolution of African American economic life.  My forthcoming book, Savings and Trust: The Rise and Betrayal of the Freedman's Bank, chronicles the rise and fall of the Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company.  Savings and Trust emphasizes the importance of the Freedman's Bank and its collapse by connecting the bank's failure to modern issues such as the racial wealth gap.  I am also working on A Short History of Inequality, which will interrogate the ways in which inequality has pervaded and structured American life.  Both books are under contract with W.W. Norton. \nMy first book, Unfree Markets: The Slaves' Economy and the Rise of Capitalism in South Carolina (April 2021 on Columbia University Press, in the Columbia Series in the History of U.S. Capitalism), explores the economic lives of enslaved people, not as property or bonded laborers, but as active participants in their local economies.  Unfree Markets provides the fullest account to date of the strategies that enslaved people used to create their own networks of commerce, from the colonial period to the Civil War.  It confronts one of the most enduring questions in African American history and the history of American capitalism: How beneficial was capitalism to African Americans?  Through examining an array of archival records, from slaveholder account books to legislative petitions, Unfree Markets shows that even though enslaved people shaped the increasingly capitalist economy of slavery, economic participation alone could not secure what bondspeople wanted most—their freedom.  The time and energy that enslaved people invested in their own economic enterprises did not bring them out of slavery; instead, it kept them enslaved.  Ultimately, Unfree Markets demonstrates that the vestiges of race-based economic inequality are not in the late-nineteenth or twentieth centuries, but in the period of legal slavery.\nDuring the 2022-23 academic year, my research will be supported by a Carnegie Fellowship, funded through the Carnegie Corporation of New York.  During the 2023-26 academic years, my research will be supported by a Mellon New Directions Fellowship, funded through the Mellon Foundation.  \nI was a Consortium Fellow at the McNeil Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and a Quin Morton Teaching Fellow in Princeton University’s Writing Center.  My dissertation, “’Felonious Transactions: The Legal Culture and Business Practices of Slave Economies in South Carolina, 1787-1860,” was a finalist for the C. Vann Woodward Prize from the South Historical Association, a finalist for the SHEAR Dissertation Prize from the Society for Historians on the Early American Republic, and a finalist for the Herman E. Krooss Dissertation Prize from the Business History Conference.  My scholarship has been supported by the Program in American Studies at Princeton University, the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University, the Program in International and Regional Studies at Princeton University, and the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia.  \nI currently serve on the Board of Trustees of the Business History Conference and was a Trustee of the Midland School.  I am also on the editorial boards of Enterprise & Society: The International Journal of Business History, The Journal of the Civil War Era, UVA Press.",

His work and teaching focus on the global history of the 20th Century, in particular the era of the two world wars and the cold war.\nHe received his B.A. degree from Kenyon College in 1986 and his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1994, working under the supervision of Paul Kennedy.

After publishing The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent, 1945-present (Doubleday/Anchor, 2002), he went on to write about the experience of liberation at the close of World War II. His book, The Bitter Road to Freedom: A New History of the Liberation of Europe (Free Press, 2008) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, a winner of the George Louis Beer Prize, and a Financial Times bestseller in the UK. In 2010, he moved to the University of Virginia. His most recent book is The Age of Eisenhower: America and the World in the 1950s (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2018), which was a New York Times bestseller.

        "intro": "Biography\nI am an historian of modern Europe, with a particular focus on central and eastern Europe in the twentieth century. My first book, Communism's Public Sphere: Culture as Politics in Cold War Poland and East Germany, explored the political role of cultural spaces in the Eastern Bloc. Under communist regimes that banned free speech, political discussions shifted to spaces of art: theaters, galleries, concert halls, and youth clubs. I show how these venues turned into sites of dialogue and contestation. While officials used them to spread the communist message, artists and audiences often flouted state policy and championed alternative visions. Cultural spaces therefore came to function as a public sphere, or a rare outlet for discussing public affairs. \nCommunism's Public Sphere won the Kulczycki Book Prize from the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies, received Honorable Mention for the Oskar Halecki Award from the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America, and was shortlisted for the Waterloo Centre for German Studies Book Prize.\nMy current project, tentatively titled \"A History of Heritage,\" examines the origins of UNESCO and its concept of cultural heritage. In the summer of 2024, I'll be a fellow at the Käte Hamburger Centre for Advanced Study, inherit: Heritage in Transformation, at Humboldt University in Berlin.",

        "intro": "Biography\nI am a historian of religion and culture in early modern Europe. I am especially interested in the ways in which Christian belief shaped ordinary Europeans' approaches to their daily lives in a rapidly changing world, and in the broader social and cultural histories of German- and Dutch-speaking Europe. Methodologically, my work explores and transcends the boundaries between history, musicology, and visual studies. My book, Singing the Resurrection: Body, Community, and Belief in Reformation Europe, The New Cultural History of Music (New York: Oxford University Press, 2018) combines two distinct yet deeply related themes: beliefs about the resurrection of the body and the devotional songs through which those beliefs were formed and given expression. Before the sixteenth century, the universal resurrection of the dead at the Last Judgment was a powerful symbol of the eternal persistence and unity of European Christendom, as medieval Christians were reminded every time the Creed was chanted in the Mass. In the Reformation, that image was shattered. Sixteenth-century Christians, my book reveals, developed a range of new interpretations of resurrection, and they gave voice to them through very different songs. Those songs of resurrection, I argue, reveal the diversity of understandings of body and community that emerged in the sixteenth century, and with them, a plurality of conceptions of the role that faith in resurrection should play in earthly life. As Anabaptist martyrs sang at the stake, for example, they asserted that execution was no threat for those with faith in resurrection. As Reformed exiles left their homes behind, never to return, the psalms they sang aboard ships and in foreign places of refuge proclaimed that resurrection would bring them to the heavenly home from which they would never be expelled. Ultimately, my book suggests, resurrection and song reveal how the meanings of faith and practice were reframed in the context of the Reformation: once understood as the tie that bound all Christians, belief was reimagined as an individual's way of being in the world.\nI am currently at work on a book project that explores the Anabaptist practice of outdoor worship in sixteenth-century Europe. Where historians have typically dismissed the use of caves, mountaintops, and forests as worship sites as a mere effort to evade persecution, my project recovers the meaning that these places and practices bore for Anabaptists themselves. Through testimony from trial records and the evidence of the landscape itself, I ask how the practice of outdoor worship was engaged with broader conceptions of creation and the natural world in the Reformation period.",

        "intro": "Biography\nFor some indication of my academic work generally, see https://virginia.academia.edu/AllanMegill.\nFall Semester 2023:  I shall be teaching a new class, HIEU 3501, Academic History, Public History, & Other Kinds. This class is primarily intended for beginning history majors, but is not limited to that group. Students will read, research, and write about the connections and tensions between academic history and non-academic histories, such as public history, memory-oriented and justice-oriented histories, as well as the burgeoning genres of mediatic history, in which past events and situations are re-presented in vivid ways in art installations, films, TV series, video games, and other, still-developing, digital and AI media. The first few weeks of the semester will offer an introduction to history as an evidence-based discipline. In the rest of the semester students will explore how this aspect of history relates to the various other aspects of our human interest in history -- affective, aesthetic, moral/ethical, and, of course, propagandistic. There will be considerable emphasis on students' own reading, researching, and writing/thinking, with well-signposted deadlines along the way. I shall also be teaching HIEU 3812: Marx as philosopher and social scientist. This class explores the development of Marx's thinking from its roots in his simultaneous engagement, as a young man born in Trier in southwestern Germany, with both the Western philosophical tradition and with the political and social conditions of his own time.\nI shall be on leave in Spring Semester 2024 and Fall Semester 2024.    \nMy Classes Generally:  Among my classes, HIEU 3802 (Darwin, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, and others) and HIEU 3812 (Marx) have no particular prerequisites apart from an ability and willingness to work systematically and read attentively, immersing yourself in what is there in the text. It also helps to be able to follow the rules specific to the class, and not assume that the class is like other classes you have taken. While the material studied is in a broad sense philosophical, the method followed is historical: the aim is to see how a particular strain of ideas developed over time.\nI often teach HIEU 1502, which, by a history department rule, is restricted to first-year and second-year students. It is not restricted to students who intend to major in history -- on the contrary, I welcome first-and second-year students with a variety of academic and career goals. The class puts a heavy emphasis on evidence-based thinking and on clear writing. These skills are useful for everyone. Further, the class will give you insight into how real historians think, which will be useful to you even if you do not take any other history class. However, I suggest that you do take some additional classes in the history department, not only for the information they will give you, but also for their modelling of evidence-based thinking concerning the wide diversity of human societies.\nVarious documents describing or otherwise connnected with these, and other, courses that I teach can be found on my academia.edu site: https://virginia.academia.edu/AllanMegill/Teaching-Documents .\nLetters of reference: To save breath I indicate here what I ask students or former students in my classes to give me if I agree to write a letter of reference for them: I would possibly be open to writing a letter of reference for you if that is needed. I require the following from people for whom I write: information concerning what is required by the internship, job, fellowship, and so on that you are applying for; a copy of your unofficial transcript; a statement as to which professors and  classes have had the most impact on you; an informal CV (which may include personal information that you would not put on a work-related CV or resume, if such information might be helpful to a reference-letter writer); and a statement concerning your central interests and talents as well as concerning your plans for the next few years. Students should send reminders, with deadlines clearly indicated in the e-mail subject line, as deadlines approach. \nVisiting scholars: Over the years I have often hosted in my classes visitors from other countries (they have come from China [including Hong Kong], Brazil, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Norway, and Germany). This presence has often been illuminating for regularly-enrolled undergraduate and graduate students, offering a certain widening of vision. It is best, however, if I am teaching a relevant class--that is, a class relevant to the prospective visitor's interests--during the period the visitor will be here (most relevant to vistors' interests have been HIEU 3812 Marx, and HIEU 5062 Philosophy and Theory of History).",

        "intro": "Biography\nI am a historian of the twentieth century United States. My work focuses on how organized interest groups and everyday Americans influence government policy and the terms of political debate. My current research focuses on the rise of whistleblowing as a form of regulation, a labor right, a mechanism for bureaucratic accountability, a way to save money, and a very contested expression of idealized citizenship.\nAlong with Katherine Turk, I am currently working on SILKWOOD, a political biography of nuclear whistleblower Karen Silkwood. We focus on the civil case brought by her estate, Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee—a case that began in Oklahoma City but ended up before the Supreme Court in a decision that vindicated the right of employees to sue the nuclear industry in state courts. SILKWOOD shows how the social forces of the 1970s—feminism, environmentalism, civil libertarianism, organized labor—produced a nuclear martyr, and trial of the century.\nMy first book, The Cigarette: A Political History is a history of tobacco in the twentieth century that places farmers, government officials, and citizen-activists at the center of the story. Rather than focusing exclusively on \"Big Tobacco,\" I argue that  domestic and global cigarette consumption rose through the efforts of organized tobacco farmers and US government officials; and that it fell as a result of local government action spurred by the efforts of citizen-activists and activist lawyers. The Cigarette won the Willie Lee Rose Prize from the Society for Southern Women Historians for the best book in Southern History and the PROSE Award for North American History from the Association of American Publishers. It was a finalist for the LA Times Book prize and one of Smithsonian Magazine's \"Best History Titles of 2019.\"",

Her research focuses on premodern non-elite Arab history, particularly people with disabilities, users of sign language, Romani groups (ghurabā’), craftspeople, and enslaved laborers and entertainers. She is the author of two monographs: Difference and Disability in the Medieval Islamic World: Blighted Bodies (Edinburgh, 2012) and Roma in the Medieval Islamic Word: Literacy, Culture and Migration (I.B. Tauris, 2022). For this latest book she was awarded the prestigious 2022 Dan David Prize, the largest history award in the world, and the 2023 Monica H. Green Prize for Distinguished Medieval Research by the Medieval Academy of America. It was also awarded Honorable Mention in the Middle East Medievalists 2023 Book Prize competition.\nIn 2021 Professor Richardson and Dr. Boris Liebrenz co-published The Notebook of Kamal al-Din the Weaver, an edition and study of an early Ottoman weaver’s Arabic notebook. She is currently writing her third monograph Black Basra: Race, Slavery and Science in Early Islamic History. At its core this book will be a history of the port city of Basra from its founding in 637 until c. 1000 CE, centering the lives and experiences of free and unfree black people (al-sūdān), who were broadly defined at that time as dark-skinned inhabitants of Africa, Asia, and the southern Indian Ocean.\nProfessor Richardson has been named a 2024-2025 Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar. Her work has also been supported by the National Endowment of the Humanities, the Marie Curie Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the City University of New York.

Drawing on previously unexamined sources in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, he argues that the seasonally freezing, thawing, and flooding river was a critical actor in imperial border creation and contestation. As part of his multilingual research on Korean history, Seeley has also published on topics such as animal disease control in colonial Korea, US-Korean diplomatic history, Korean tiger-human relations, and the history of Japanese colonial zoos in Seoul and Taipei. \nPrior to joining the History faculty at UVA Seeley completed his doctoral studies at Stanford University, where his research was supported by the Korea Foundation and the Freeman Spogli Institute.

Her doctoral dissertation, entitled Statewise: Jurisdictional Fictions, Transnational Politics and Remaking the Nation State on the Chiapas-Guatemala Border, 1821-1899, looks at the way marginalized, transnational actors played critical roles in defining the limits of Mexican and Guatemalan territory as well as the course of these countries’ international relations.  She has also published on the role of Maximilian of Habsburg’s execution in framing U.S.-Mexican nineteenth century diplomacy, as well as numerous translations on Mexican art and culture.  Her current projects include expanding her work on transnational communities and state-making in Mexico and Central America as well as an analysis of representations of the modern Maya in Mexico's National Anthropology Museum, including the mid-1990s' suspension of the Modern Maya exhibit during the Zapatista uprising.",

        "intro": "Biography\nI am a cultural and intellectual historian of Muslim communities in Africa, with an emphasis on the Sahel region of West Africa. My broader research interests focus on the transmission and circulation of knowledge, shifts in epistemology, and the changing social, political, and intellectual roles of Muslim scholars over time. I am also interested in questions related to the construction of different forms of authority, the function of various writing practices, as well as placing and investigating the connections between West Africa and the Mediterranean and Atlantic worlds.\nI am completing a book on the construction of religious authority and political imagination in West Africa through a historical ethnography of the teachings, actions, and political thought of one of the most important nineteenth century West African Muslim intellectuals, ʿUmar Tall (d.1864). ʿUmar Tall studied numerous Islamic religious sciences, including jurisprudence and theology, and became one of the most significant representatives of the nascent Tijāni Sufi order. Beginning in 1852, he took up arms to initially defend his community of followers and subsequently established a large polity in Western Sahel and the Middle Niger Valley. My book challenges teleological approaches to ʿUmar Tall, as well as established narratives that only analyze him as a traditional temporal ruler or a state builder. Instead, by focusing on his mastery over Islamic knowledge and the changing nature of his community in West Africa, I focus on the different layers of his authority and highlight how ʿUmar Tall’s religious authority became the site through which he worked out his own political authority and a new vision of sovereignty. The methodological and theoretical approaches of my book on political theology and sovereignty will provide a framework for new studies on the relationship between religion and politics in the precolonial African history.",

Their work studies how collective understandings of progress are defined by competing discourses of social value and economic productivity, and how technologies often hide regressive ideals while espousing \"revolutionary\" or \"disruptive\" goals. Their research investigates everything from how power and AI intersect, to the long history of transphobic algorithmic bias, to the connections between gender and technological change. \nHicks’s current work focuses on how gender and sexuality bring hidden technological dynamics to light, and how the experiences of women and LGBTQIA people change the core narratives of the history of computing in unexpected ways. They are currently working on a book about the gendered nature of digital infrastructure and the intersections between queerness and resistance in the history of digital computing. Hicks's multiple award-winning first book, Programmed Inequality (MIT Press, 2017), looks at how the British lost their early lead in computing by discarding women computer workers, and what this cautionary tale can tell us about current issues in high tech. Hicks is also co-editor of the book Your Computer Is On Fire (MIT Press, 2021), a volume of essays about how we can begin to fix our broken high tech infrastructures.\nBefore joining UVA, Hicks was Associate Professor of History of Technology at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, and was a fellow at the National Humanities Center in 2018-2019. Hicks holds a Ph.D. and M.A. from Duke University in History, and a B.A. in History from Harvard. More information about their work can be found at: marhicks.com.",

        "intro": "Biography\nLouis Nelson is Professor of Architectural History and the Vice Provost for Academic Outreach in the Office of the Provost. He is a specialist in the built environments of the early modern Atlantic world, with published work on the American South, the Caribbean, and West Africa. His current research engages the spaces of enslavement in West Africa and in the Americas, working to document and interpret the buildings and landscapes that shaped the trans-Atlantic slave trade. He has a second collaborative project working to understand the University of Virginia as a landscape of slavery. Nelson is an accomplished scholar, with two book-length monographs published by UNC and Yale University Presses, three edited collections of essays, two terms as senior co-editor of Buildings and Landscapes--the leading English language venue for scholarship on vernacular architecture--and numerous articles. He is also a celebrated teacher, having won a university-wide teaching award in 2007 and serving as the 2008 UVA nominee for a state-wide Outstanding Faculty Award. Nelson's teaching and research focuses on the close examination of evidence-both material and textual-as a means of interrogating the ways architecture shapes the human experience. The majority of his work focuses on the early American South, the Greater Caribbean, and the Atlantic rim. His early work on colonial religious architecture is best realized in his monograph, The Beauty of Holiness: Anglicanism and Architecture in Colonial South Carolina (UNC, 2008). Winner of the 2010 SESAH Best Book of the Year Prize, The Beauty of Holiness examines the ways Anglican churches in colonial South Carolina-the nexus of many social landscapes-express regional identity, social politics, and divergent theologies of the sacred. \"Sensing the Sacred: Anglican Material Religion in Early South Carolina,\" published in the Winterthur Portfolio, was also recognized for its contributions to the field of architectural history; it was named the 2008 SESAH best article of the year. His interest in the colonial South then led him past the \"sacred 13\" colonies. For a decade her served as the director of a summer field program in Falmouth, Jamaica, popularly referred to as the Falmouth Field School. One by product of this work is the Falmouth Project, a GIS-based data information system used as a repository for ongoing work in Falmouth. Working together with more than one hundred students over more than 10 years, his fieldwork in Jamaica and the Leeward Islands has resulted in some of the first systematic recording of eighteenth and nineteenth-century architecture in the British Caribbean.",

I am especially fascinated with studying the complex interplay of race and culture in the antebellum South. My first book, Freedom Has a Face: Race, Identity, and Community in Jefferson's Albemarle, 1780-1865, came out with the University of Virginia Press in 2012. I have also begun research for a second book-length project examining the history of a nineteenth century interracial island fishing community in coastal Maine. Additionally, I am very excited to be co-chairing the UVa President's Commission on Slavery and the University. Those scholarly interests grew out of my experience as an undergraduate history major here at the University of Virginia, where so many of my professors challenged and inspired me as a thinker and scholar both inside and outside the classroom. I am very excited to have returned to UVa and to have the opportunity to guide current University students as they discover and pursue their own academic interests.",

        "intro": "Biography\nBackground\nGeorge H. Gilliam is an historian and the producer, writer, and narrator of the five-part series, \"The Ground Beneath Our Feet: Virginia's History in the Civil War,\" produced in cooperation with WCVE-TV (Central Virginia's PBS member station) which was broadcast beginning in February 1999. An attorney in private law practice in Charlottesville for more than 25 years before he returned to graduate school to study history, Gilliam is the author of \"Business Entities--A Virginia Law Practice System,\" (Michie-Bobbs Merrill, 1982) and, with photographer Mark Martin, of \"Racin',\" the story of NASCAR/Winston Cup stock car racing (Howell Press, 1989).  His master's thesis, \"Making Virginia Progressive: Courts and Parties, Railroads and Regulators, 1890-1910,\" was published in the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, and his article \"Reconfiguring Virginia,\" was the lead article in the 2000 volume of The Smithfield Review. He has contributed numerous biographical sketches to the Virginia Dictionary of Biography. His doctoral dissertation, directed by Professor Edward L. Ayers,  closely examines the economic history of Virginia during the 19th century.\nBefore returning to the academy, he was a member of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of Central Fidelity National Bank, Richmond, Virginia, from 1979 to 1998 (when it merged into Wachovia Bank), was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Southern Title Insurance Corporation from 1978 to 1983, and developed commercial real estate.\nLong active in public service, he was Chairman of the State Board for Community Colleges (the governing body for Virginia's 23 community colleges), to which he was appointed by Governor Charles S. Robb in 1982 and reappointed by Governor Gerald L. Baliles in 1986. He was a Commissioner of the Education Commission of the States from 1986 to 1994. From 1989 to 1993 he served as Chairman of the Pesticide Control Board, a regulatory board created in 1989 by the Virginia General Assembly. He served on the City Council of the City of Charlottesville, 1972-1976, and was the Democratic candidate for U. S. Congress from Virginia's Seventh Congressional District in 1974. He has served on the Vestry of St. Paul's Memorial Church, as an officer or board member of numerous volunteer organizations, was the first president of Camp Holiday Trails (a camp for medically-handicapped children), and was the first chairman in the state of Virginia of a regional community mental health services board (Region X).\nSince returning to the University to study history, he has taught at Piedmont Virginia Community College, Washington and Lee University, and, since 1999, at the University of Virginia. He has taught Virginia Politics and Government, the American History survey, seminars in Southern Progressivism, and, for the past twelve years, Virginia history. From 2003-2011 he directed the Miller Center Forum, and hosted approximately four hundred guests for the one-hour public affairs program now carried by more than one hundred PBS member stations around the country, taped before a live audience in Charlottesville.\nHe is married to the former Caroline Page O'Neill (\"Page\"), a graduate of Wellesley College and the University of Virginia Law School. He is the father of three daughters, Louise, a graduate of Sweet Brier College, now employed by the University of Virginia Department of Space and Real Estate Management; Carter, a graduate of the University of Virginia and the Peabody School of Education, Vanderbilt University, now a public school teacher in Irvine, California; and Caroline, a graduate of Columbia University and of the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, now a consultant in Alexandria, Virginia; and one son, George, a student and businessman in Birmingham, Alabama. He has seven grandsons and two granddaughters.\nGilliam is a 1988 graduate of the Buck Baker Driving School in Rockingham, N. C., where he studied high-performance driving in Winston Cup-type stock cars. He has driven in events at Summit Point, W. Va., Charlotte, N. C., and Rockingham, N. C. racetracks. He is a licensed pilot and a consistently awful, yet clearly obsessed, golfer.",

        "intro": "Biography\nI was somewhat of a rarity on the faculty at the University of Virginia–a native Virginian. I did my undergraduate studies in French and mathematics as well as my M.S. in mathematics UVa before pursuing my graduate work at the University of Chicago. I earned my Ph.D. in history from Chicago, where I was privileged to work under the supervision of I. N. Herstein in mathematics and Allen G. Debus in the history of science. My doctoral work explored the history of the theory of algebras and especially the role played by Joseph H. M. Wedderburn in that development.\nFrom 1988 to 2023, I was on the faculty at UVa where I had a joint appointment in the Departments of History and Mathematics, teaching the history of science in the History Department and mathematics and the history of mathematics in the Mathematics Department. I have been involved with Historia Mathematica, the international journal for the history of mathematics, first as Book Review Editor (1990–1994), then as Managing Editor (1994–1996), then as Editor (1996–1999), and now as a member of the editorial board (2000–present). I served as a member of the Council of the American Mathematical Society (1998–2001) and as a member of the Council of the History of Science Society (2001–2004). In 2002, I was elected the Chair of the International Commission for History of Mathematics (ICHM) for a term for the four calendar years from 2002 through 2005 and reelected for another four-year term from 2006 through 2009.  I am currently the Co-Editor-in-Chief of The Mathematical Intelligencer, and I will begin a tour of duty as an Associate Editor of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in January 2024.",

This work led directly to congressional passage of the bipartisan Help America Vote Act of 2002.  He later took two public service leaves to return to full-time government service.  The first of these leaves was in 2003-04, to direct the 9/11 Commission.  The Commission's landmark report was published in 2004.  The second leave was in 2005-07 to serve as Counselor of the Department of State, a deputy to Secretary Rice.  He is currently leading the privately-sponsored Covid Commission Planning Group (2021).\nHe has also been a member of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board both for President Bush (2001-03) and for President Obama (2011-13), one of few individuals to serve on this board in administrations of both parties.  He was a member of the Defense Policy Board (2015-17).  He also advised the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s program in global development (2007-12).",
